**Thomas C. Anderson**

![](Anderson.jpg)

Anderson’s research, which draws upon both historical archival studies as well as plant biology and botany, explores how early modern colonial encounters with the natural world helped shape our modern pharmacopoeia. To the early modern naturalist and explorer, the keys to life’s greatest mysteries were to be found in the petals, leaves, and anthers of strange and exotic plants. Amerindian horticultural, botanical, and art-historical contributions to this complicated and multifaceted story have only recently emerged as a subject of scholarly interest. Anderson uses the history of medicine and botany to help elucidate the unknown pasts that have nonetheless had a major impact on the construction of scientific and medical knowledge up to today. Anderson is a master’s candidate at Columbia University. He holds a bachelor’s in history and French and Francophone Studies from Hamilton College. Anderson has explored transoceanic acclimatization and the indigenous Guanche pharmacopoeia in the Canary Islands; the early modern history of imperial science and medicine in Paris; ethnobotany and plant taxonomy at the New York Botanical Gardens; historical manuscripts concerning colonial plants and their uses at the John Carter Brown Library; and toxicity and plant defense systems at Cornell University.

**Camilo Uribe Botta**

![](Botta.jpg)

Uribe Botta’s current PhD research explores the orchid trade between Colombia and the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century, focusing on the global connections created around the plants in both sides of the Atlantic. His research analyzes the networks around these plants, from their hunting in the Colombian jungles to their conservation in British Botanical Gardens or collections from wealthy British collectors. Its overall aim is to chart the economic, scientific, and cultural conditions that led to the success of tropical orchids as a scientific and a commodity object. He focuses on the agency of orchids in global history and their relationship with humans in the nineteenth-century commerce. Botta is a PhD candidate in history at the University of Warwick. He holds a bachelor’s and a master’s in history from Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia. Uribe Botta has been assistant curator and registrar and collections manager of the Museo Colonial and Museo Santa Clara, two public institutions that are part of the Ministry of Culture of Colombia.

**Verónica Marallana Chaves**

![](Chaves.jpg)

Matallana Chaves’s undergraduate thesis research focuses on the history of textile work in Colombia and the use of natural fibers with a botanical-historical approach. Given the country’s sociocultural diversity, material cultural objects with an artisan trajectory play a key role in the consolidation of identities and symbolic networks. Although these objects have a consolidated historical trajectory, their agency has been changing as they have been touched by the dynamics of conservation, commodification, and resignification. Her work brings these points of tension and breakdowns in craft traditions to the surface. Chaves is in her third year of the undergraduate program in history at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where she has participated in projects on digital history, environmental history, and oral history and memory. She is currently part of the Public and Digital History group and is linked to the Laboratory of Historical Cartography and Digital History.

**Yao Jiang**

![](Jiang.jpg)

Jiang’s research explores the reinterpretation and reintroduction of the Chinese garden into modern discourse as a critical instrument to document China’s continuous cultural traditions. He is interested in the construction material exchanges and flows of the Chinese garden and its social and cultural relations, especially the introduction and cultivation of Chinese plants into the United States in the late twentieth century. For his thesis, Jiang is focusing on how the Astor Chinese Garden Court in the Metropolitan Museum of Art reshaped America’s understanding of the Chinese garden using several lenses, including the field of plant humanities. Jiang is a master student in architectural history at the University of Virginia. He holds a Bachelor of Art in environmental design from Tongji University.

**Cati Kalinoski**

![](Kalinoski.jpg)

Kalinoski’s research examines plant-life exhibition work through the lens of performance to investigate theories of time, extinction, and the natural world. Her research is grounded on what we as humans can learn from plants and how they shape humans’ positions in the world. Taking from disciplines such as performance studies, anthropology, museum studies, environmental studies, and philosophy, Kalinoski’s work images a new form of politics around the lessons learned from nature. Kalinoski is a master candidate at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts Performance Studies program and a theater practitioner. Her work is centered on plant studies and theories extinction through the lens of performance and exploring new notions of time in the Anthropocene.

**Wouter Klein**

![](Klein_300x300.jpg)

Wouter Klein is Plant Humanities fellow at Dumbarton Oaks. A historian from the Netherlands, he received his PhD from Utrecht University in 2018. He is interested in the interconnected history of medicine, pharmacy, and botany in the early modern period; the circulation of knowledge and commodification processes of therapeutic drugs; and digital research methods to study medical practices of the past over the long term. He has a particular interest in the availability of materia medica in the past, either as commercial goods in trade records, research specimens for academic physicians, or commodified products for the general public. His research aims to unravel the question of how the global dimensions of commerce, science, and society helped some non-European natural substances become major commercial ingredients for medicines while others had much less success in the early modern medical marketplace. To tell those stories, his research makes use of large collections of digital historical data, like private correspondence, pharmaceutical manuals, auction records, and newspaper advertisements.

##
**Anna Lawrence**

![](Lawrence.jpg)

Lawrence’s research explores the sociopolitical lives of flowers in Victorian Britain, considering the different plant-human relations at play in the commodification of cut-flowers, botanical instruction for women and girls, domestic working-class floriculture, and settler colonial horticulture. Grounded theoretically in critical plant studies, Lawrence is interested in the material intimacies at play in these different spheres of plant-human interaction and how they were thought about at the time, seeking to illuminate a world of alternative and exaggerated sensibilities between people and plants to help us question our own approaches to plant nature today. Lawrence is a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge where she also undertook her undergraduate and master’s degrees. She is a cultural and historical geographer interested in plant-human relations. In addition to Victorian floriculture, she has worked on weeds and urban nature, as well as Caribbean music and culture in the United Kingdom. Anna currently co-convenes the graduate student-led research group Vegetal Epistemologies in Cambridge.

**Lucas Mertehikian**

![](Mertehikian.jpg)

Mertehikian’s research offers a new lens on how to look at Latin American identity and its cultural and political relation with the United States with a focus on collecting efforts carried out by American scientists, diplomats, and scholars from the 1840s to the 1970s. Specifically, he analyzes three collections as case studies: Harvard University’s Latin American botanical collection, Dumbarton Oaks’ Pre-Columbian art collection, and Princeton University’s Latin American literary manuscripts collection. His current work examines how American botanist Asa Gray first took an interest in Latin American nature in the nineteenth century and the political implications that informed his collection of Latin American specimens. Mertehikian is a PhD candidate in Romance languages and literatures at Harvard University. He holds a licenciatura in literature from the Universidad de Buenos Aires and a master’s in Latin American Studies from the Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero, both in Argentina.
