Batsaki leads a collaboration with JSTOR Labs to develop an open access digital platform that will highlight primary sources about plants and connect them to large databases such as Global Plants and the Biodiversity Heritage Library. She also oversees scholarly programming that brings together intergenerational teams of students and researchers to investigate and narrate important cultural histories of plants for the digital platform under development.

Ashley Buchanan is the Postdoctoral Fellow for the Plant Humanities Initiative at Dumbarton Oaks. She is a historian of the early modern world, with a particular interest in plants, recipes, and medicinal cultures in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. She received her PhD in early modern history from the University of South Florida in 2018. Her research spans many topics which includes the history of science and medicine, women, and politics as well as the dynamics of gender and authority. Her current book project investigates the social, cultural, and political significance of pharmaceutical experimentation as well as the medicinal and botanical patronage at the late Medici Court (1650-1743). Her goal is to broaden the global dimension of recipes by studying the numerous exotic plants imported into Tuscany from the New World, East Africa, and Southeast Asia in the late 18th century. Ashley was a junior fellow in residence with the Medici Archive Project at the Archivio di Stato di Firenze and an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellow at The Huntington.

**Wouter Klein**

![](Klein_300x300.jpg)

Wouter Klein is Plant Humanities fellow at Dumbarton Oaks. A historian from the Netherlands, he received his PhD from Utrecht University in 2018. He is interested in the interconnected history of medicine, pharmacy, and botany in the early modern period; the circulation of knowledge and commodification processes of therapeutic drugs; and digital research methods to study medical practices of the past over the long term. He has a particular interest in the availability of materia medica in the past, either as commercial goods in trade records, research specimens for academic physicians, or commodified products for the general public. His research aims to unravel the question of how the global dimensions of commerce, science, and society helped some non-European natural substances become major commercial ingredients for medicines while others had much less success in the early modern medical marketplace. To tell those stories, his research makes use of large collections of digital historical data, like private correspondence, pharmaceutical manuals, auction records, and newspaper advertisements.
