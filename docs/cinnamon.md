### The cinnamon challenge

In 2012-2013, the 'cinnamon challenge' was a short-lived internet hype. Although the instruction is simple enough – try to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon at once – it proves to be virtually impossible in practice. Trying to ingest dry, ground cinnamon bark initially causes a severe choke reaction, characterised by extreme exhalation of cinnamon powder (known as 'dragon breath'). Subsequently, the cinnamon combines with saliva in the mouth to produce an indigestable clutter in the back of the throat. Thankfully, this [quite dagerous assignment](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-3418) will only be a marginal footnote in the history of cinnamon. Those who know cinnamon only from an endless series of ridiculous YouTube videos, or as a quotidian kitchen spice, will be surprised to learn that the real challenge of cinnamon has been an ongoing effort for 2000 years, to find out what cinnamon actually is, as a plant and as a medicine.

### Forgotten knowledge and fabricated history
Cinnamon had a long history before any European ever saw 'true' cinnamon (_Cinnamomum verum_ J.Presl) growing on Sri Lanka. Here immediately lies the key to understanding the history of cinnamon: most of cinnamon's history is about a plant-based product carrying that name, not about any particular plant species like the one mentioned above. This is a crucial observation, because a lot of confusion about cinnamon emanates from the incorrect equation of _names_ with _plants_. To be more precise: in the Latin west it has long been assumed that the plants _cinnamomum_ (κιννάμωμον in Greek) and _cassia_ (κασία), as described by ancient medical authorities (notably Dioscorides), are the same as those found in the East Indies in the sixteenth century, to which those names were attached. A recent revision of archaeological, historical, linguistic and botanical evidence, however, has suggested that the cinnamon of ancient history was probably an East-African plant, _Cassia abbreviata_ Oliv., which is not related to the genus _Cinnamomum_.[^ref1]

How could this confusion last so long? First, a possible explanation for the shift from an East-African to a South-East-Asian plant is linguistic. In medieval Latin, the name for cinnamon from the East Indies was _canella_, which still resounds in many European languages today. For some reason, the names _canella_ and _cinnamomum_ both began to be associated with the East Indian spice in the Middle Ages.[^ref2] In the wake of the European voyages of discovery in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, European scholars writing about cinnamon would turn to classical, not medieval sources, to understand the spice and its properties. They managed to resolve the discrepancies they found between classical descriptions of the spice and the plant that was found in Sri Lanka. In his book [_Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India_](http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/vester/content/pageview/4968642) (1563), the Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta, who worked in Goa, explained the differences between his own observations and classical authors' descriptions of cinnamon by the fact that the latter had only known the processed spice, not the actual plant.[^ref3]

A second, and much more surprising reason for the long-lasting confusion over cinnamon, is the fact that the exact same issue still exists today. This is a striking case of forgotten knowledge in modern science. In the nineteenth century, Flückiger and Hanbury already noted in their [_Pharmacographia_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/111743#page/490/mode/1up) (1874) that cinnamon in Antiquity did not come from Sri Lanka. It only became a noticeable export item there in the thirteenth century, when political power on the island shifted to the cinnamon-producing areas in the southwest.[^ref4] Rather, they argued, it must have been _cassia lignea_ (a common historical name for _cassia_, generally believed to be _Cinnamomum cassia_ (L.) J.Presl), imported from China through Arabia and East Africa. Although this narrative is debatable, it is still less imaginative than the one proposed by J. Innes Miller (1969). Miller claimed there had been an interoceanic Spice Route in Antiquity, spanning all corners of the Indian Ocean world. Although this fantastic concept has been rejected by historians, Sri Lanka still features in many accounts of cinnamon in Antiquity.[^ref5]

### Cinnamon as a tool of empire
The attraction of cinnamon – 'true' or other – as a means to enhance the power of a state, by displaying its control over exotic riches, predates the early modern period. For example, many coins can be found from the reign of Roman emperor Trajan (reigned 98-117 CE), showing a personification of Arabia, who holds a bundle of cinnamon sticks. The motif can be associated with Trajan's conquests on the eastern border of the empire, which he managed to extend briefly unto the Persian Gulf. Such coins served as propaganda, to emphasize the relation between the authority of the empire and the conquered lands.[^ref7]

The quest for spices, cinnamon among them, was one of the most important aims that inspired Europeans of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to sail the oceans. With success, as many explorers claimed. Columbus brought samples of cinnamon with him on his first journey to the New World, to help native inhabitants guide him to cinnamon trees. He sent samples of a kind of 'white cinnamon' (probably _Canella winterana_ (L.) Gaertn.) back to Spain from his second journey. Similarly, Juan Sebastián Elcano (1486/1487-1526), who completed Magellan's circumnavigation of the world after the commander himself had been killed on the Philippines, petitioned succesfully to have cinnamon sticks, cloves and nutmeg depicted on his coat of arms, to commemorate his role in opening up the spice route to the East Indies.[^ref6]

Once 'true' cinnamon had begun to be associated only with cinnamon from Sri Lanka, European states strove to gain a foothold on the island, to get access to the cinnamon trade. From the sixteenth century onwards, local rulers bargained with the Portugese, and later the Dutch, for a share in the cinnamon trade, in exchange for political and/or military assistance against their rivals. The Portuguese made humble attempts to create a monopoly after they first arrived on Sri Lanka in 1505. They soon realized that this was impossible without getting involved in local politics on the island. Therefore, the Portuguese engaged in 'reluctant imperialism' to get access to cinnamon: they needed a permanent presence on the island, and eventually signed an agreement with the king of Kotte in 1533 to buy large amounts of cinnamon.[^ref8]

The Dutch made even stronger, concerted efforts to get a hold on cinnamon. They signed a treaty with the king of Kandy in 1638, hoping this would give them a share of the cinnamon trade, which was still dominated by the Portuguese at the time. After the Portuguese were defeated in Colombo in 1656 and Jaffnapatnam in 1658, the Dutch controlled many coastal areas of the island, while the kingdom of Kandy ruled the island's interior. The relation between the Dutch and the king of Kandy was strained. The Dutch intensified the process of cinnamon peeling. Cinnamon trees were scattered throughout the forests of the island, so groups of local peelers often had to cross Portuguese and, later, Kandian territory to reach the areas where the trees grew. As it was impossible for the Dutch to keep a military grip on this enormous territory, or on individual groups of peelers, there was little they could do when peelers chose, or were forced, to switch allegiance. Therefore, bribing the king of Kandy was a recurring means to leave peelers alone, in order not to interrupt the supply of cinnamon.

Peelers were specialized laborers from the Singalese caste _Salagama_ (also known as _Saliya_ or _Chaliya_). Although their skills were indispensable for the cinnamon trade, they were treated harshly by the Dutch. Each year, the peelers gathered in Colombo to pledge loyalty to the Dutch governor (a ceremony called _paresse_). There was a long peeling season for cinnamon between May and August, and a short one between January and February. On both occassions, groups of men were sent off into the woods with nothing but paring knives and an amount of rice. Each man was obliged to bring back 12 _robes_ (of 56 pounds each) at the end of the summer season. Boys from 12 years of age had to contribute proportionally. Dutch sources often complained about peelers as lazy and unreliable, but the peelers had a hard life. They were away from home for months, had to provide for themselves while working in the forests, where they were subject to diseases, and they were severely punished if they did not meet their quotum.[^ref9]

The restrictions of the Dutch on cinnamon production and export made it the only real monopoly on Sri Lanka in the early modern period. Smuggling was severely punished. In 1704, Bengal traders were allowed to export small amounts of cinnamon, which would not affect the monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) too much. In the 1720s, export restrictions were loosened for several products, but not cinnamon.[^ref10] The tight grip of the Dutch was also felt internally. Cinnamon harvesters had long been accustomed to clearing plots of forest to create a temporary cultivated field (called a _chena_). Under Dutch rule, they were no longer allowed to practice species circulation on a _chena_ once the plot was planted with cinnamon, so as not to diminish the total acreage. The VOC governemnt i
