### The cinnamon challenge

In 2012-2013, the 'cinnamon challenge' was a short-lived internet hype. Although the instruction was simple enough – try to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon at once – it proved to be virtually impossible in practice. Trying to ingest dry, grinded cinnamon bark initially causes a severe choke reaction, characterised by extreme exhalation of cinnamon powder (known as 'dragon breath'). Subsequently, the cinnamon combines with saliva in the mouth to produce an indigestable clutter in the back of the throat. Thankfully, this [ment](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-3418) will only be a marginal footnote in the history of cinnamon. Those who know cinnamon only from an endless series of ridiculous YouTube videos, or as a quotidian kitchen spice, will be surprised to learn that the real challenge of cinnamon has been an ongoing effort for 2000 years, to find out what cinnamon actually is, as a plant and as a medicine.

### A global history

Cinnamon already had a global history long before any European ever saw the 'true' cinnamon (_Cinnamomum verum_ J.Presl) growing on Sri Lanka. And here immediately lies the key to understanding the history of cinnamon: most of cinnamon's history is about a plant-based product carrying that name, not about any particular plant species like the one mentioned above. This is a vital observation, because a lot of confusion about cinnamon emanates from the incorrect equation of _names_ with _plants_. To be more precise: in the Latin west it has long been assumed that the plants _cinnamomum_ (κιννάμωμον in Greek) and _cassia_ (κασία), that were described by ancient medical authorities, were the same plants as the ones with those names that were found in the East Indies in the sixteenth century. A recent revision of archaeological, historical, linguistic and botanical evidence, however, has suggested that the cinnamon of ancient history was probably the East-African species _Cassia abbreviata_ Oliv., which is not related to the genus _Cinnamomum_ at all.

How could such confusion last so long?

### Cinnamon as a tool of empire
Once 'true' cinnamon had begun to be associated only with the cinnamon from Sri Lanka, European states strove to gain control of the island, which would mean a _de facto_ monopoly on the cinnamon trade. But the attraction of cinnamon as a means to enhance the power of a state, by displaying its control over exotic riches, predated the early modern period. Many coins can be found from the reign of Roman emperor.[^ref1]
