### The cinnamon challenge

In 2012-2013, the 'cinnamon challenge' was a short-lived internet hype. Although the instruction was simple enough – try to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon at once – it proved to be virtually impossible in practice. Trying to ingest dry, grinded cinnamon bark initially causes a severe choke reaction, characterised by extreme exhalation of cinnamon powder (known as 'dragon breath'). Subsequently, the cinnamon combines with saliva in the mouth to produce an indigestable clutter in the back of the throat. Thankfully, this <span url="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-3418">quite dangerous assignment</span> will only be a marginal footnote in the history of cinnamon. Those who know cinnamon only from an endless series of ridiculous YouTube videos, or as a quotidian kitchen spice, will be surprised to learn that the real challenge of cinnamon has been an ongoing effort for2000 years, to find out what cinnamon actually is, as a plant and as a medicine.

### A global history

Cinnamon already had a global history long before any European ever saw the 'true' cinnamon (_Cinnamomum verum_ J.Presl) growing on Sri Lanka. And here immediately lies the key to understanding the history of cinnamon: most of cinnamon's history is about a plant-based product carrying that name, not about any particular plant species like the one mentioned above. This is a vital observation, because a lot of confusion about cinnamon emanates from the incorrect equation of _names_ with _plants_. To be more precise: in the Latin west it has long been assumed that the plants _cinnamomum_ (κιννάμωμον in Greek) and _cassia_ (κασία), that were described by ancient authorities, were in fact the same plants as those found in the East Indies in the sixteenth century. The assumption persisted into the twenty-first century,
