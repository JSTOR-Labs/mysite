### What’s in a Name?

There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet geranium.[^ref1] With their vibrant red flowers and sweet, rose scent, these cheerful plants always adorned the dining table and dominated the garden in a “blaze of color” at his country home, Gad’s Hill Place, in Kent.[^ref2] Attendees at his public readings could always count on seeing a scarlet geranium displayed in his buttonhole, and his appreciation of the flower was such that his daughter, Mamie Dickens, even recalls her sister having said to him, “I believe, papa, that when you become an angel your wings will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet geraniums.”[^ref3]

However, you might be surprised to learn that the scarlet geranium with which Dickens was so enamored was not actually a _Geranium_. In fact, it was a _Pelargonium_ – _Pelargonium inquinans_, to be exact. These two genera, the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ have been embroiled in a long history of taxonomic confusion, which dates back to the 1670s. SENTENCE. Despite naturalists proving that the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ are two distinct genera, the public grew so accustomed to using the common name “geranium” for both types of plants that we still do so today.

So how can we tell the history of the forgotten _Pelargonium_, a plant that is a familiar cultural fixture for so many of us – but one that so few people know by its true identity? Perhaps it is time to put the _Geranium_ (scarlet or otherwise) to one side, and to narrate instead the lesser-known story of the _Pelargonium_, to excavate its forgotten history – from its unique morphology and nomenclatural genealogy, to its far-reaching impact in the spheres of industry, technology, agriculture, culture, and society. A cultural history of the  _Pelargonium_ that attends to its use as an ornamental and an aromatic in the nineteenth century reveals why its popularity outpaced accurate taxonomic grouping and some reasons that the flower remains so beloved today.
