There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet “geranium.”[^ref1] With their vibrant red flowers and sweet, rose scent, these cheerful plants always adorned the dining table and dominated the garden in a “blaze of color” at his country home, [Gad’s Hill Place](https://thegardenstrust.blog/2020/01/25/dickens-and-gardens/), in Kent.[^ref2] Attendees at his public readings could always count on seeing a scarlet geranium displayed in his buttonhole, and his appreciation of the flower was such that his daughter, Mamie Dickens, even recalls her sister having said to him, “I believe, papa, that when you become an angel your wings will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet geraniums.”[^ref3] This evocative quote along with the author are remembered each year, when [The Dickens Fellowship](https://www.dickensfellowship.org/) places an ivy-and-red-geranium wreath at his grave on the anniversary of his death.

However, you might be surprised to learn that the scarlet flower with which Dickens was so enamored was not a member of the genus _Geranium_. In fact, it belonged to an altogether different one, _Pelargonium_.[^ref4] The two genera _Pelargonium_ and _Geranium_ have been embroiled in a long history of taxonomic confusion, which dates back to the late seventeenth century. As the debate over how to classify pelargoniums roiled in botanical circles of the mid-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, its popularity steadily increased, first as a greenhouse exotic and then as a collector’s showpiece. Once nurseries made hardy garden varieties available to the masses, in the mid-nineteenth century, the public had grown accustomed to using the common name “geranium” for both types of plants, and for the most part, we continue to do so today.

So how can we tell the history of the forgotten _Pelargonium_, a plant that is now a familiar cultural fixture for so many of us, but one that so few people know by its true identity? Perhaps it is time to put the _Geranium_ to one side, and to narrate instead the lesser-known story of the _Pelargonium_, to excavate its forgotten history—from its unique morphology and nomenclatural genealogy, to its far-reaching impact in the spheres of industry, technology, agriculture, culture, and society. An interdisciplinary history of the _Pelargonium_ that attends to the plant’s popularity during the long nineteenth century reveals how horticultural technologies fueled cultural excitement for growing and displaying the flower, first in glasshouses and later in garden beds, in tandem with fashions for smelling and wearing its varied scents. This visual narrative also elucidates some reasons that Dicken’s favored flower still infuses gardens with its brilliant hues, painted foliage, and pleasurable fragrances today.

### Pelargonium Morphology: Fruit and Flower

The _Pelargonium_ and its relatives _Geranium_ and _Erodium_ belong to the family _Geraniaceae_. The scientific names of these genera indicate their morphological resemblance to long-billed birds and, at least superficially, one another. The name _Pelargonium_ comes from the Greek _pelargos_ (“[stork](https://proxy.europeana.eu/2022608/TFM_SVB_NDM_00535?view=http%3A%2F%2Fmm.dimu.no%2Fimage%2F01SzmY7g3Z%3Fdimension%3D800x800&disposition=inline&api_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.europeana.eu%2Fapi)”), which alludes to the plant’s long, beak-shaped fruit. Similarly, _Geranium_ from _géranos_ (“crane”) and _Erodium_ from _erodios_ (“heron”) describe the columnar fruit capsules characteristic of some species.

Morphological traits not only inspired the names _Pelargonium_ and _Geranium_, but also distinguish members of the genera. As this visualization shows, several key differences can be observed by comparing the reproductive systems of the plants: the flowers. The _Pelargonium_ flower parts are arranged bilaterally around one axis making them quite distinct from the radially oriented ones of the _Geranium_. Another difference is that, while the _Geranium_ has five nectaries at the base of the petals, the _Pelargonium_ has only one embedded in the receptacle. Yet another divergence between the two is the number of fertile stamens and their groupings. The _Pelargonium_ has between one and seven stamens, attached at the base; the _Geranium_, meanwhile, has either five or ten free stamens. Finally, while _Pelargonium_ flowers can be many vivid shades of scarlet, purple, white, or pink, those of the _Geranium_ can be dark blue, purple, pink, or white—though they are never red.

The _Pelargonium_, which includes more than 280 accepted species, is native to Southern Africa, Saint Helena, Asia Minor, Madagascar, and Australia. However, the great majority of these species are endemic to the Cape of South Africa, which is a biodiversity hotspot. It is not surprising, then, that Portuguese and Dutch traders first harvested pelargoniums, both live plants and seeds, from the Cape in the late 1500s. They then transported that fragile and precious cargo to Europe on their return from making colonial voyages.

Of the many _Pelargonium_ species, _Pelargonium_ _triste_ was probably the first to reach Europe around 1600, and it was subsequently introduced to France and Britain.[^ref5] By 1672, ten more species had been collected—mostly from Table Mountain, on the Cape Peninsula—and brought back to the <span data-click-map-flyto="52.159, 4.484">Leiden Botanical Garden</span> by Paul Hermann, a medical officer with the Dutch East India company (VOC).[^ref6] Hermann’s 1689-book _[Paradisi Batavi Prodromus](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/13582)_ records the collection of a pelargonium, though its identity remains a mystery.[^ref7] He, like other physicians of the day, highly valued non-native plants for their potential medicinal, culinary, and nutritive properties and studied them accordingly.

The nomenclature confusion surrounding the _Pelargonium_ began when _Pelargonium_ _triste_ (“sad pelargonium”)  was first brought to and cultivated at the Leiden Botanical Garden in the late seventeenth century. _P._ _triste_ was erroneously grouped with _Geranium_ and thus misnamed _Geranium triste_, as evidenced in the plant portrait shown at right. That misrecognition of _P._ _triste_ stems from the fact that Europeans were already familiar with some [geraniums](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:327764-2) that are endogenous to the Mediterranean and simply grouped pelargoniums with plants they already knew. This visualization of the global nomenclature history of the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ provides insights about why there is still confusion surrounding the name and taxonomic designation of the _Pelargonium_.

As the interactive timeline above explained, botanists have struggled to disentangle the genera _Pelargonium_ and _Geranium_ since the mid-eighteenth century. Indeed, Carl Linnaeus, in his 1753-book [_Species Plantarum_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/669#/summary), retained the generic name _Geranium_ for twenty pelargoniums including the _Pelargonium zonale_.[^ref8] Because Linnaean taxonomy was so revered at that time, his near contemporary Charles-Louis L’Héritier de Brutelle’s work to distinguish the _Pelargonium_ as an independent genus was overlooked.[^ref9] Eventually, in the early-1800s, Robert Sweet introduced a serious classification system to ease the shortfall in Linnaean nomenclature. Sweet created ten new genera in the _Geraniaceae_ family, and his five-volume study of pelargoniums, _Geraniaceae: The Natural Order of Gerania_, remains a crucial source of information on the early nineteenth century.[^ref10] Yet, despite naturalists proving that they were two different genera, pelargoniums had already attained such popularity, particularly in England and France, that the name “geranium” stuck.

Early-1830s Britain saw the groundbreaking invention of the Wardian case, a sealed glass container in which plants could survive, without watering, for months at a time. Prior to that technology, botanists encountered dreadful difficulties transporting live specimens during overseas voyages. Such journeys lasted for months, during which time plants suffered from exposure to salt water and harsh weather, extreme changes in climate, and lack of proper care. Indeed, John Livingstone estimated in 1819 that “only one in a thousand plants survived the journey.”[^ref11] The Wardian case created the conditions for a major globe plant migration on an unprecedented scale, as the glazed box was employed extensively by colonial enterprises, botanic gardens, plant nurseries, and individual collectors.[^ref12] This advance in plant transport had a knock-on effect in the domestic space as well. It was now possible to cultivate exotics indoors in such ornamental glass furnishings, safely protected from the industrial pollution in the air as well as the varying temperatures of the British climate.[^ref13]

### Pelargonium-mania in the Victorian Era

It was against this backdrop that _Pelargoniums_ soon became the mainstay of all municipal gardens in Victorian England. The 1837 _Floricultural Cabinet_ listed the best pelargoniums for bedding as one of the old faithful multipurpose plants. The ubiquity of the plant in public spaces is also celebrated in E. Adveno Brooke’s 1858 book _The Gardens of England_. As he explains, the bright scarlet pelargonium bloomed nearly everywhere from stone vases to flowerbeds and parterres. These locations, shown in illustrations at right, include the upper and lower terrace gardens of Bewood, the colonnade of Alton Gardens, as well as the parterre of Harewood.

The pelargonium was a favored plant of municipal gardeners because the hardy evergreen showed off its blooms for extended periods, flowering even in slightly chillier climates. More significantly, nursery owners adored the plant because it was easy to grow and hybridize, producing cultivars in a seemingly infinite variety year-round. Indeed, vendors were falling over one another to market the newest, most magnificent, and sweetest-smelling pelargoniums to meet the demand for the choicest blooms. Other factors contributing to the mania for the pelargonium were the arrival of mass-produced pots and planters for displaying ornamentals and, at least initially, excitement surrounding the exotic connotations of plant due to its Southern African provenance. Desire to obtain novel cultivars became so frenzied that some compared it to the infamous tulip-buying spree, known as “tulipomania,” that occurred in Holland in the 1630s.[^ref14]

By the end of the Industrial Revolution, the _Pelargonium_ had also been firmly instated as a staple in British domestic interiors, gardens, and patios. In his hugely popular 1875 book [_The amateur's flower garden_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/145001#/summary), Shirley Hibberd included designs for creating a harmonious pelargonium garden—“geranium garden”—based on the plant’s striking colour variations. In the layout of a panel garden, Hibberd suggests two potential summer schemes: one for a red-harmony garden, and another for a blue-harmony style.[^ref15] By 1895, writers such as Donald McDonald were still echoing Hibberd’s domestic horticultural penchant for the plant; McDonald wrote that, “no bouquet or basket of flowers was considered complete unless plentifully perfumed with the foliage of Cape or other sweet Pelargoniums,” a testament to the long-standing appeal of _Pelargoniums_ in British Victorian culture.[^ref16]

### The “Genteel” Geranium and Working-class Culture

The ubiquity of the _Pelargonium_ in the Victorian era soon began to carry a cultural significance all its own – and it was not always a positive one. In 1864’s _The Book of Flowers_, Caroline Kirkland follows the poet Leigh Hunt in describing the _Geranium_ (of course, really a _Pelargonium_) as a _genteel_ plant. She writes, “As the Geranium offers so large a variety of species to gratify every taste, it is appropriately called genteel.”[^ref17] Although we may construe her comment as nothing more than an attestation to the _Pelargonium’s_ universal charms, her use of the word “genteel” takes on additional meaning when we consider the significance of the _Pelargonium_ in the context of working-class culture.
<param ve-image primary fit="contain" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/master/images/Victorian_language_of_flowers_.jpg" title="The broad range of varieties and scents of _Pelargonium_ (under the name _Geranium_, of course) made it a favourite in the Victorian “language of flowers.” This concealed language allowed members of upper-class society to use specific flowers as a sort of code to pass on secret, often romantic, messages that they were forbidden from speaking aloud. Here, we can see that the scarlet Geranium (_P. inquinans_) means “comfort.” Excerpt from L. Burke’s _The Miniature Language of Flowers_, Biodiversity Heritage Library">

For many lower-class Victorian families who did not have gardens, growing _Pelargoniums_ in pots and displaying them in windows or balconies became a way to try and project a sense of belonging to higher classes to which they aspired. In other words, as the century wore on, the iconic flower became a visual marker for the lower classes’ (often awkward) attempts to convey a social standing superior to their own. Naturally, such attempts rarely landed in the way they were intended, and before long, horticulturalists began to look down on the _Pelargonium_ with a certain derision. Jekyll writes in 1919 that, “It is a common thing for friends to express surprise at seeing scarlet Geraniums...in my garden, forgetting that it was not the fault of the plants that they were misused or employed in dull or even stupid ways.”[^ref18] His comments reveal that it was not the plants themselves that were particularly offensive to garden specialists; rather, it was the way they had been used by certain cack-handed individuals, presumably the lower classes, that made them such a subject of scorn in horticultural circles.

Partridge & Co, c. 1869. Children’s Book Collection. Library Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, UCLA.]">


As a result, the _Pelargonium_ at the turn of the century became a symbol for the working class’s ungainly attempts at propriety and a gauche lack of style–and it was instrumentalized as such throughout art and literature. Catherine Horwood notes that, “If there is one plant that sums up the attitude of Victorian sentimentalists towards the unfortunate working class in the nineteenth century, it is the forlorn red ‘geranium’ sitting on a cottage window-sill. Hundreds of artists used this as a symbol of aspirations to respectability.”[^ref19] With this context, we might understand Kirkland’s pretensions to the “genteel _Geranium_” as an ironic statement, more in line with the OED’s definition of “genteel” as “being characteristic of those who are possessed with a dread of being taken for ‘common people’, or who attach exaggerated importance to supposed marks of social superiority...in educated language it has always a sarcastic or at least playful colouring,” than to assertions of true gentility.[^ref20]

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, specifically in Paris. As part of a massive project to urbanize Paris, overseen by Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, architects designed new parks, gardens, squares, and promenades and oversaw the revitalization of existing green spaces with fresh plantings.[REF] In his book _Les Promenades de Paris_, Adolphe Alphand inventories the myriad "trees, shrubs and plants" selected by him and others to beautify the city.[REF] Needless to say, they chose many different types of showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for mass-producing them. Although Alphand’s book primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too.[REF] The French-bred pelargoniums, which retained some of their exotic associations with Southern Africa, served as live manifestations of the global reach of the French Empire and its colonial agenda especially because the plants were then propagated in French Algiers to produce fragrant oils.

In 1847, the French perfume industries of Grasse, including the company of Léon Chiris Léopold Chiris? , introduced the pelargonium to Algeria in order to cultivate and produce aromatic oil from it. Algeria was considered an ideal place for doing so due to its warm arid and semi-arid climate and the low cost of colonial labor needed for the "preparation and planting of cuttings, weeding of fields, harvesting of the material to be distilled." Perfumers selected pelargoniums because most species have a sweet aroma similar to roses. Such oils are extracted by [distillation](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/viewer/1e1gx/Distillation-process?_ga=2.191538920.352386283.1596674591-989112353.1594909187) and the substances that evaporate and condense again are taken from the leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits and seeds of the plant.

The Chiris company introduced a particular pelargonium hybrid, "_Geranium rosat_," to Boufarik, Algeria, selecting "a trentaine of wild Pelargonium species, from cells that are found most frequently in the Cap de Bonne Espérance region." That selection allowed the Chiris establishments to earn a stable profit.[REF] In 1865, Chiris built a 3,000 square meter factory in the Saint-Marguerite domain in Boufarik, which was first acquired in 1836. Its production was centered on _Pelargoniums_, orange trees, and other aromatic plants.[REF] However, the headquarters in Boufarik closed once it was nationalized in 1963, as did the other headquarters in the former European colonies.

Today, pelargonium oil continues to be industrially produced in factories across the globe, most notably in Egypt and China.[REF] Significantly, the confusion surrounding pelargonium nomenclature in Europe contexts also exists in China. More than 50% of Chinese packaging uses “Geranium Essential Oil” as its English translation, even though the product is labeled as _Tianzhu Kui You (Pelargonium Oil)_ in Chinese. It is said that the name _Tianzhu Kui_ was introduced by Junyu Zhang in 1933 based on his studies in Japan. The word _Tianzhu Kui_ is from _ゼラニウム_, which is pronounced as _Geranium_ in English.

### Conclusion

Although the _Pelargonium_ by any other name would smell as sweet, our recognition of its unique identity is long overdue. Indeed, the _Pelargonium_’s almost-forgotten global history extremely rich blossoming as it does at the intersections of colonial trade, botany, agriculture, gardening, art, culture, and industry. Telling the story of the _Pelargonium_ as an entity separate from the _Geranium_, illuminates just some of the many ways in which it has been interwoven with human histories – hiding in plain sight, as it were, by virtue of its long-persisting misnomer.
