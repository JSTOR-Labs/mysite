### What’s in a Name?

There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet geranium.[^ref1] With their vibrant red flowers and sweet, rose scent, these cheerful plants always adorned the dining table and dominated the garden in a “blaze of color” at his country home, Gad’s Hill Place, in Kent.[^ref2] Attendees at his public readings could always count on seeing a scarlet geranium displayed in his buttonhole, and his appreciation of the flower was such that his daughter, Mamie Dickens, even recalls her sister having said to him, “I believe, papa, that when you become an angel your wings will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet geraniums.”[^ref3]

However, you might be surprised to learn that the scarlet flower with which Dickens was so enamored was not actually a _Geranium_. In fact, it was a _Pelargonium_ – _Pelargonium inquinans_, to be exact. These two genera, the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ have been embroiled in a long history of taxonomic confusion, which dates back to the 1670s. SENTENCE. Despite naturalists proving that the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ are two distinct genera, the public grew so accustomed to using the common name “geranium” for both types of plants that we still do so today.

So how can we tell the history of the forgotten _Pelargonium_, a plant that is a familiar cultural fixture for so many of us – but one that so few people know by its true identity? Perhaps it is time to put the _Geranium_ (scarlet or otherwise) to one side, and to narrate instead the lesser-known story of the _Pelargonium_, to excavate its forgotten history – from its unique morphology and nomenclatural genealogy, to its far-reaching impact in the spheres of industry, technology, agriculture, culture, and society. A social and cultural history of the _Pelargonium_ that attends to its use as an ornamental and an aromatic in the nineteenth century reveals a fervor of excitement not just for growing and displaying the flower but also for smelling and wearing its scent, both of which contribute to its enduring popularity today.

### Pelargonium Morphology: Fruit and Flower

The _Pelargonium_ is a perennial bush, with a strong and aromatic smell and a long bloom period. The particular morphology of the plant lends the genus its name; _Pelargonium_ comes from the Greek word _pelargos_ (“[stork](https://proxy.europeana.eu/2022608/TFM_SVB_NDM_00535?view=http%3A%2F%2Fmm.dimu.no%2Fimage%2F01SzmY7g3Z%3Fdimension%3D800x800&disposition=inline&api_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.europeana.eu%2Fapi)”) which alludes to the long, almost beak-shaped fruit.

Morphological traits also differentiate the _Pelargonium_ from the _Geranium_. Several key differences between the genera can be observed by comparing the reproductive systems of the two plants: the flowers. The _Pelargonium_ flower parts are arranged bilaterally around one axis making them quite distinct from the radially oriented ones of the _Geranium_. Another difference is that, while the _Geranium_ has five nectaries at the base of the petals, the _Pelargonium_ has only one embedded in the receptacle. A final divergence between the two is the number of fertile stamens and their groupings. The _Pelargonium_ has between one and seven stamens, attached at the base; the _Geranium_, meanwhile, has either five or ten free stamens.
