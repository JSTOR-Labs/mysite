There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet geranium.[^ref1] With their vibrant red flowers and sweet, rose scent, these cheerful plants always adorned the dining table and dominated the garden in a “blaze of color” at his country home, Gad’s Hill Place, in Kent.[^ref2] Attendees at his public readings could always count on seeing a scarlet geranium displayed in his buttonhole, and his appreciation of the flower was such that his daughter, Mamie Dickens, even recalls her sister having said to him, “I believe, papa, that when you become an angel your wings will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet geraniums.”[^ref3]

However, you might be surprised to learn that the scarlet flower with which Dickens was so enamored was not actually a _Geranium_. In fact, it was a _Pelargonium_ – _Pelargonium inquinans_, to be exact. These two genera, the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ have been embroiled in a long history of taxonomic confusion, which dates back to the 1670s. SENTENCE. Despite naturalists proving that the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ are two distinct genera, the public grew so accustomed to using the common name “geranium” for both types of plants that we still do so today.

So how can we tell the history of the forgotten _Pelargonium_, a plant that is a familiar cultural fixture for so many of us – but one that so few people know by its true identity? Perhaps it is time to put the _Geranium_ (scarlet or otherwise) to one side, and to narrate instead the lesser-known story of the _Pelargonium_, to excavate its forgotten history – from its unique morphology and nomenclatural genealogy, to its far-reaching impact in the spheres of industry, technology, agriculture, culture, and society. A social and cultural history of the _Pelargonium_ that attends to its use as an ornamental and an aromatic in the nineteenth century reveals a fervor of excitement not just for growing and displaying the flower but also for smelling and wearing its scent, both of which contribute to its enduring popularity today.

### Pelargonium Morphology: Fruit and Flower

The _Pelargonium_ is a perennial bush, with a strong and aromatic smell and a long bloom period.  The particular morphology of the plant lends the genus its name; _Pelargonium_ comes from the Greek word _pelargos_ ("[stork](https://proxy.europeana.eu/2022608/TFM_SVB_NDM_00535?view=http%3A%2F%2Fmm.dimu.no%2Fimage%2F01SzmY7g3Z%3Fdimension%3D800x800&disposition=inline&api_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.europeana.eu%2Fapi)”) which alludes to its long, almost beak-shaped fruit.

Morphological traits also differentiate the _Pelargonium_ from the _Geranium_. Several key differences between the genera can be observed by comparing the reproductive systems of the two plants: the flowers. The _Pelargonium_ flower parts are arranged bilaterally around one axis making them quite distinct from the radially oriented ones of the _Geranium_. Another difference is that, while the _Geranium_ has five nectaries at the base of the petals, the _Pelargonium_ has only one embedded in the receptacle. A final divergence between the two is the number of fertile stamens and their groupings. The _Pelargonium_ has between one and seven stamens, attached at the base; the _Geranium_, meanwhile, has either five or ten free stamens.

The _Pelargonium_ is native to Southern Africa, Saint Helena, Asia Minor, Madagascar, and Australia, though it was first collected by Europeans in present-day South Africa in the late 1500s. Portuguese and Dutch traders harvested pelargoniums there, transporting the plants to Europe on their return from making colonial voyages.

The nomenclature confusion began when the plant now known as _Pelargonium_ _triste_ was first brought to and cultivated at the Leiden Botanical Garden in the late seventeenth century. _P._ _triste_ was erroneously grouped with _Geranium_ and thus misnamed _Geranium triste_ due to the superficial similarities between the genera _Geranium_ and Pelargonium. This visualization of the two plants’ overlapping global nomenclature history provides insights about why there is still confusion surrounding the name and taxonomic designation of the _Pelargonium_.

Botanists have struggled to disentangle the _Pelargonium_ and the _Geranium_ since the mid-1750s. Carl Linnaeus, in his 1753 [_Species Plantarum_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/669#/summary), retained the generic name _Geranium_ for 20 pelargoniums including the _Pelargonium zonale_.[^ref5] Because Linnaean taxonomy was so revered at that time, Charles-Louis L’Héritier de Brutelle’s work to distinguish the _Pelargoniums_ as an independent genus was overlooked.[^ref6] Eventually, by creating ten new genera in the _Geraniaceae_ family, Robert Sweet introduced a serious classification system in 1820 to ease the shortfall in Linnaean nomenclature.[^ref7] However, by the early nineteenth century, pelargoniums had already attained so much popularity, particularly in England and France, that the name “geranium” stuck.

Early-1830s Britain saw the groundbreaking invention of the Wardian case, a sealed glass container in which plants could survive, without watering, for months at a time. Prior to that technology, botanists encountered dreadful difficulties transporting live specimens during overseas voyages. Such journeys lasted for months, during which time plants suffered from exposure to salt water and harsh weather, extreme changes in climate, and lack of proper care. Indeed, John Livingstone estimated in 1819 that “only one in a thousand plants survived the journey.”[^ref8] The Wardian case created the conditions for a major globe plant migration on an unprecedented scale, as the glazed box was employed extensively by colonial enterprises, botanic gardens, plant nurseries, and individual collectors.[^ref9] This advance in plant transport had a knock-on effect in the domestic space as well. It was now possible to cultivate exotics indoors in such ornamental glass furnishings, safely protected from the industrial pollution in the air as well as the varying temperatures of the British climate.[^ref10]

### _Pelargonium_-mania in the Victorian Era

It was against this backdrop that _Pelargoniums_ soon became the mainstay of all municipal gardens in Victorian England. The 1837 _Floricultural Cabinet_ listed the best pelargoniums for bedding as one of the old faithful multipurpose plants. The ubiquity of the plant in public spaces is also celebrated in E. Adveno Brooke’s 1858 book _The Gardens of England_. As he explains, the bright scarlet pelargonium bloomed nearly everywhere from stone vases to flowerbeds and parterres. These locations, shown in illustrations at right, include the upper and lower terrace gardens of Bewood, the colonnade of Alton Gardens, as well as the parterre of Harewood.

The pelargonium was a favored plant of municipal gardeners because the hardy evergreen showed off its blooms for extended periods, flowering even in slightly chillier climates. More significantly, nursery owners adored the plant because it was easy to grow and hybridize, producing cultivars in a seemingly infinite variety year-round. Indeed, vendors were falling over one another to market the newest, most magnificent, and sweetest-smelling pelargoniums to meet the demand for the choicest blooms. Other factors contributing to the mania for the pelargonium were the arrival of mass-produced pots and planters for displaying ornamentals and, at least initially, excitement surrounding the exotic connotations of plant due to its Southern African provenance. Desire to obtain novel cultivars became so frenzied that some compared it to the infamous tulip-buying spree, known as “tulipomania,” that occurred in Holland in the 1630s.[^ref11]
<param ve-image primary fit="contain" manifest="https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:47667076" seq="47">

By the end of the Industrial Revolution, the _Pelargonium_ had also been firmly instated as a staple in British domestic interiors, gardens, and patios. In his hugely popular 1875 book [_The amateur's flower garden_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/145001#/summary), Shirley Hibberd included designs for creating a harmonious pelargonium garden—“geranium garden”—based on the plant’s striking colour variations. In the layout of a panel garden, Hibberd suggests two potential summer schemes: one for a red-harmony garden, and another for a blue-harmony style.[^ref12] By 1895, writers such as Donald McDonald were still echoing Hibberd’s domestic horticultural penchant for the plant; McDonald wrote that, “no bouquet or basket of flowers was considered complete unless plentifully perfumed with the foliage of Cape or other sweet Pelargoniums,” a testament to the long-standing appeal of _Pelargoniums_ in British Victorian culture.[^ref13]

### The “Genteel” _Geranium_ and Working-class Culture

The ubiquity of the _Pelargonium_ in the Victorian era soon began to carry a cultural significance all its own – and it was not always a positive one. In 1864’s _The Book of Flowers_, Caroline Kirkland follows the poet Leigh Hunt in describing the _Geranium_ (of course, really a _Pelargonium_) as a _genteel_ plant. She writes, “As the Geranium offers so large a variety of species to gratify every taste, it is appropriately called genteel.”[^ref14] Although we may construe her comment as nothing more than an attestation to the _Pelargonium’s_ universal charms, her use of the word “genteel” takes on additional meaning when we consider the significance of the _Pelargonium_ in the context of working-class culture.
<param ve-image primary fit="contain" url="https://ia903006.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?id=miniaturelangua00burk&itemPath=%2F15%2Fitems%2Fminiaturelangua00burk&server=ia903006.us.archive.org&page=n33_w436" title="<The broad range of varieties and scents of _Pelargonium_ (under the name _Geranium_, of course) made it a favourite in the Victorian “language of flowers.” This concealed language allowed members of upper-class society to use specific flowers as a sort of code to pass on secret, often romantic, messages that they were forbidden from speaking aloud. Here, we can see that the scarlet Geranium (_P. inquinans_) means “comfort.” Excerpt from L. Burke’s _The Miniature Language of Flowers_, Biodiversity Heritage Library">

For many lower-class Victorian families who did not have gardens, growing _Pelargoniums_ in pots and displaying them in windows or balconies became a way to try and project a sense of belonging to higher classes to which they aspired. In other words, as the century wore on, the iconic flower became a visual marker for the lower classes’ (often awkward) attempts to convey a social standing superior to their own. Naturally, such attempts rarely landed in the way they were intended, and before long, horticulturalists began to look down on the _Pelargonium_ with a certain derision. Jekyll writes in 1919 that, “It is a common thing for friends to express surprise at seeing scarlet Geraniums...in my garden, forgetting that it was not the fault of the plants that they were misused or employed in dull or even stupid ways.”[^ref15] His comments reveal that it was not the plants themselves that were particularly offensive to garden specialists; rather, it was the way they had been used by certain cack-handed individuals, presumably the lower classes, that made them such a subject of scorn in horticultural circles.

Partridge & Co, c. 1869. Children’s Book Collection. Library Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, UCLA.]">


As a result, the _Pelargonium_ at the turn of the century became a symbol for the working class’s ungainly attempts at propriety and a gauche lack of style–and it was instrumentalized as such throughout art and literature. Catherine Horwood notes that, “If there is one plant that sums up the attitude of Victorian sentimentalists towards the unfortunate working class in the nineteenth century, it is the forlorn red ‘geranium’ sitting on a cottage window-sill. Hundreds of artists used this as a symbol of aspirations to respectability.”[^ref16] With this context, we might understand Kirkland’s pretensions to the “genteel _Geranium_” as an ironic statement, more in line with the OED’s definition of “genteel” as “being characteristic of those who are possessed with a dread of being taken for ‘common people’, or who attach exaggerated importance to supposed marks of social superiority...in educated language it has always a sarcastic or at least playful colouring,” than to assertions of true gentility.[^ref17]

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, specifically in Paris. As part of a massive project to urbanize Paris, overseen by Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, architects designed new parks, gardens, squares, and promenades and oversaw the revitalization of existing green spaces with fresh plantings.[REF] In his book _Les Promenades de Paris_, Adolphe Alphand inventories the myriad "trees, shrubs and plants" selected by him and others to beautify the city.[REF] Needless to say, they chose many different types of showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for mass-producing them. Although Alphand’s book primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too.[REF] The French-bred pelargoniums, which retained some of their exotic associations with Southern Africa, served as live manifestations of the global reach of the French Empire and its colonial agenda especially because the plants were then propagated in French Algiers to produce fragrant oils.

In 1847, the French perfume industries of Grasse, including the company of Léon Chiris Léopold Chiris? , introduced the pelargonium to Algeria in order to cultivate and produce aromatic oil from it. Algeria was considered an ideal place for doing so due to its warm arid and semi-arid climate and the low cost of colonial labor needed for the "preparation and planting of cuttings, weeding of fields, harvesting of the material to be distilled." Perfumers selected pelargoniums because most species have a sweet aroma similar to roses. Such oils are extracted by [distillation](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/viewer/1e1gx/Distillation-process?_ga=2.191538920.352386283.1596674591-989112353.1594909187) and the substances that evaporate and condense again are taken from the leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits and seeds of the plant.

That selection allowed the Chiris establishments to earn a stable profit.[REF] In 1865, Chiris built a 3,000 square meter factory in the Saint-Marguerite domain in Boufarik, which was first acquired in 1836. Its production was centered on _Pelargoniums_, orange trees, and other aromatic plants.[REF] However, the headquarters in Boufarik closed once it was nationalized in 1963, as did the other headquarters in the former European colonies.

### Conclusion

Although the _Pelargonium_ by any other name would smell as sweet, our recognition of its unique identity is long overdue. Indeed, the _Pelargonium_’s almost-forgotten global history extremely rich blossoming as it does at the intersections of colonial trade, botany, agriculture, gardening, art, culture, and industry. Telling the story of the _Pelargonium_ as an entity separate from the _Geranium_, illuminates just some of the many ways in which it has been interwoven with human histories – hiding in plain sight, as it were, by virtue of its long-persisting misnomer.
