### What’s in a Name?

There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet “geranium.”[^ref1] With its vibrant red flowers and showy foliage, this cheerful plant always adorned the dining table and dominated the garden in “a blaze of color” at his country home, [Gad’s Hill Place](https://thegardenstrust.blog/2020/01/25/dickens-and-gardens/), in Kent.[^ref2] Attendees at his public readings could always count on seeing a scarlet “geranium” displayed in his buttonhole, and his appreciation of the flower was such that his daughter, Mamie Dickens, even recalls her sister having said to him, “I believe, papa, that when you become an angel your wings will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet geraniums.”[^ref3]

However, you might be surprised to learn that the scarlet “geranium” with which Dickens was so enamored was not a member of the genus _Geranium_. In fact, it belonged to an altogether different one called _Pelargonium_ and was a bedding variety derived from _P. inquinans_ and _P. zonale_, probably the cultivar ‘Mrs. Pollock’ or ‘General Tom Thumb.’[^ref4]  The misidentification of the _Pelargonium_ is common today because the plant has been confused for the _Geranium_ since its introduction to Europe in the early 1600s.[^ref5] As the debate over how to classify pelargoniums roiled in botanical circles of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, new horticultural technologies and breeding techniques led to an astounding increase in the number of hybrids commercially available and their popularity soared. By the mid-1800s, the public had grown accustomed to using the common name “geranium” for the pelargonium, and for the most part, we continue to do so today.

So how can we tell the history of the forgotten _Pelargonium_, a plant that is now a familiar cultural fixture for so many of us, but one that so few people know by its true identity? Perhaps it is time to put the _Geranium_ to one side, and to narrate instead the lesser-known story of the _Pelargonium_, to excavate its forgotten history—from its unique morphology and nomenclatural genealogy, to its far-reaching impact in the spheres of industry, technology, agriculture, culture, and society. An interdisciplinary history of the _Pelargonium_ that attends to its uses in England, France, and Algeria during the long nineteenth century reveals that the modern pelargonium was an invention of the Industrial age. Bred for use as an ornamental plant or aromatic crop, these new pelargoniums possessed aesthetic or fragrant traits tailored to Victorian sensibilities with a mass appeal that still endures today.

### Pelargonium Morphology: Seedpod and Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q28507" title="Ciconiidae"> 
The _Pelargonium_ and its relatives _Geranium_ and _Erodium_ belong to the family Geraniaceae. The scientific names of these genera indicate their morphological resemblance to long-billed birds and, to some degree, each other.  _Pelargonium_, from the Greek _pelargos_ (“stork”),  alludes to the plant’s long, beak-shaped seedpods and fruit. Similarly, _Geranium_ from _géranos_ (“crane”) and _Erodium_ from _erodios_ (“heron”) describe columnar fruit capsules that are found in some species. As the dried pelargonium specimen, at right, shows, these columnar capsules emerge from the centers of flowers, aiding in seed dispersal and reproduction.

Other morphological traits, however, distinguish members of the genera _Pelargonium_ and _Geranium_ from each other. This diagram highlights several key differences that can be observed by comparing the reproductive systems of the two plants: the flowers. The _Pelargonium_ flower parts are arranged bilaterally around one axis making them quite distinct from the radially oriented ones of the _Geranium_. Another difference is that, while the _Geranium_ has five nectaries at the base of the petals, the _Pelargonium_ has only one embedded in the receptacle. Yet another divergence is the number of fertile stamens and their groupings. The _Pelargonium_ has between one and seven stamens, attached at the base; the _Geranium_, meanwhile, has either five or ten free stamens. Finally, pelargonium flowers can be red, light yellow, mauve, pink, or white; however, those of geraniums can be dark blue, purple, pink, or white, though they are never scarlet.

The _[Pelargonium](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30302759-2)_, which includes more than 280 accepted species, is native to Southern Africa, Saint Helena, Asia Minor, Madagascar, and Australia. However, the great majority of these species are endemic to the Cape Peninsula of present-day South Africa: a biodiversity hotspot. Given their concentration there, it is not surprising that Dutch traders, who first introduced pelargoniums to Europe in the early seventeenth century, harvested them from the Cape.[^ref6]

Of the many _Pelargonium_ species native to Southern Africa, _Pelargonium_ _triste_ was probably the first to reach Europe in the early 1600s.[^ref7] In 1672, several more species were collected—mostly from Table Mountain, on the Cape Peninsula—and shipped to the <span data-click-map-flyto="52.159, 4.484">Leiden Botanical Garden</span> by Paul Hermann, a medical officer with the Dutch East India company (VOC).[^ref8] Hermann is credited with introducing  _P. cucullatum_ there, and his 1689-book _[Paradisi Batavi Prodromus](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/13582)_ lists an “African geranium” or pelargonium.[^ref9] Yet, it is important to note that some mystery still surrounds the identities of these plants because there was not yet a standardized approach for naming them.

The nomenclature confusion surrounding pelargoniums started when _Pelargonium triste_ reached Europe. The plant was initially called _Geranium Indicum nocto odorato_, or “night-scented geranium of India.”[^ref10] Europeans misidentified the specimen as a geranium because they were already familiar with _[Geranium](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:327764-2)_ species, which are native to the Mediterranean Basin. Additionally, Dutch traders brought the pelargonium to Holland on their return from making colonial voyages to the East Indies, prompting some to assume, wrongly, that it was harvested from India. During this period, Jacques Philippe Cornut renamed the plant _Geranium triste_, which he depicted and described in his 1635-book _[Canadensium Plantarum](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/13506).[^ref11] The word _triste_ (“sad”) presumably alludes to the pelargonium’s dull-colored foliage or flowers, and the descriptor stuck.

In the wake of that initial nomenclature confusion, botanists of the seventeenth century struggled to recognize the differences among the genera _Pelargonium_, _Geranium_, and _Erodium_. The interactive timeline, at right, gives an overview of the nomenclature history of the _Pelargonium_, providing insights about why there is still confusion surrounding the name and taxonomic designation of pelargoniums today.[^ref12]

### Technology, Breeding, and the Modern Pelargonium

<param ve-entity eid="Q165044" title="greenhouse">
The genus _Pelargonium_ is amazingly varied, including both annual and perennial herbs that naturally occur in temperate and tropical climates. For that reason, the first plants to reach Holland were cultivated in heated greenhouses to protect them from that region’s cold and frost.[^ref13] By the early 1800s, new technologies–both for fabricating iron and plate glass and for constructing buildings with these materials–fueled a fad among the social elite for purchasing conservatories and exotic plants to grow therein.[^ref14] That innovation combined with new knowledge about hand-pollination techniques made pelargoniums, which are easily hybridized that way, an ideal choice for cultivating in such spaces and plant collectors and amateur breeders did so with gusto.[^ref15]

Another technology, the Wardian case, contributed to a tremendous expansion of ornamental plant trades in early and mid-nineteenth-century Europe. The case or sealed glass container, invented by Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, allowed plant collectors, horticulturalists, and others to transport live specimens intact during lengthy overseas voyages.[^ref16] ![Wardian case, Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, _On the Growth of Plants in Closely Glazed Cases_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristanmhanson/plant-humanities/develop/docs/pelargonium/Pelargonium_wardiancase_sm.jpg) {: .right} That advance in plant mobility made exotics more abundant, accessible, and affordable, increasing the popularity of gardening as a hobby for the upper and middle classes. The Wardian case had a knock-on effect in the domestic space as well. It enabled gardeners to cultivate foreign plants and mixed-species gardens indoors in such decorative glass furnishings.[^ref17] To meet the unprecedented demand for live plants at midcentury, savvy nursery owners developed the zonal pelargonium for bedding in gardens and, later, the regal for growing in domestic conservatories and the home. The marvelous, modern pelargonium—part natural wonder, part human invention—bloomed just as mass consumer culture embraced fresh flowers and greenery to improve nearly every aspect of daily life.

It was against this backdrop that bedding or zonal pelargoniums soon became the mainstay of most municipal and private pleasure gardens in Victorian England. The 1837-volume of the magazine _[The Floricultural Cabinet](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15889416)_ listed the best pelargoniums for bedding as one of the old faithful multipurpose plants.[^ref18] The ubiquity of the plant in the era’s most fashionable green spaces is also celebrated in Edward Adveno Brooke’s 1858-book _[The Gardens of England](Edward%20Adveno%20Brooke,%20The%20Gardens%20of%20England,%20London:%20T.%20McLean,%20%5B1858?%5D,%20https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/41414093.)_.[^ref18] As he explains, the bright scarlet pelargonium bloomed nearly everywhere from stone vases to flowerbeds and parterres. These locations, shown in [illustrations from the book designed by the author](https://thegardenstrust.blog/2018/04/14/edward-adveno-brooke-and-the-gardens-of-england/), include the upper and lower terrace gardens of Bowood House, the colonnade of Alton Gardens, as well as the parterre of Harewood House.

<param ve-entity eid="Q219217" title="tulip mania" aliases="tulipomania">
The pelargonium was a favored plant of gardeners because the hardy evergreen showed off its blooms for extended periods, flowering even in slightly chillier climates. More significantly, nursery owners adored the plant because it was easy to grow and hybridize, producing cultivars in a seemingly infinite variety year-round. Indeed, vendors were falling over one another to market the newest, most magnificent, and sweetest-smelling pelargoniums to meet the demand for the choicest blooms. Other factors contributing to the mania for the pelargonium were the arrival of mass-produced pots and planters for displaying ornamentals and, at least initially, excitement surrounding the exotic connotations of plant due to its Southern African provenance. Desire to obtain novel cultivars became so frenzied that some compared it to the infamous tulip-buying spree, known as “tulipomania,” that occurred in Holland in the 1630s.[^ref18]

By the end of the Industrial Revolution, the _Pelargonium_ had also been firmly instated as a staple in British domestic interiors, gardens, and patios. In his hugely popular 1875-book [_The Amateur's Flower Garden_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/145001#/summary), Shirley Hibberd included designs for creating a harmonious pelargonium garden—“geranium garden”—based on the plant’s striking colour variations.[^ref19] In the layout of a panel garden, Hibberd suggests two potential summer schemes: one for a red-harmony garden, and another for a blue-harmony style. By 1895, writers such as Donald McDonald were still echoing Hibberd’s domestic horticultural penchant for the plant; McDonald wrote that, “no bouquet or basket of flowers was considered complete unless plentifully perfumed with the foliage of Cape or other sweet Pelargoniums,” a testament to the long-standing appeal of _Pelargoniums_ in British Victorian culture.[^ref20]

### The “Genteel” Geranium and Working-class Culture

<param ve-entity eid="Q655213" title="Leigh Hunt">
<param ve-entity eid="Q5045123" title="Caroline Kirkland">
The ubiquity of the _Pelargonium_ in the Victorian era soon began to carry a cultural significance all its own – and it was not always a positive one. In 1864’s _[The Book of Flowers](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/56679001)_, Caroline Kirkland follows the poet Leigh Hunt in describing the _Geranium_ (of course, really a _Pelargonium_) as a _genteel_ plant.[^ref21] She writes, “As the Geranium offers so large a variety of species to gratify every taste, it is appropriately called genteel.”[^ref22] Although we may construe her comment as nothing more than an attestation to the _Pelargonium’s_ universal charms, her use of the word “genteel” takes on additional meaning when we consider the significance of the _Pelargonium_ in the context of working-class culture.
<param ve-image primary fit="contain" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/master/images/Victorian_language_of_flowers_.jpg" title="The broad range of varieties and scents of _Pelargonium_ (under the name _Geranium_, of course) made it a favourite in the Victorian “language of flowers.” This concealed language allowed members of upper-class society to use specific flowers as a sort of code to pass on secret, often romantic, messages that they were forbidden from speaking aloud. Here, we can see that the scarlet Geranium (_P. inquinans_) means “comfort.” Excerpt from L. Burke’s _The Miniature Language of Flowers_, Biodiversity Heritage Library">

<param ve-entity eid="Q452354" title="Gertrude Jekyll">
For many lower-class Victorian families who did not have gardens, growing _Pelargoniums_ in pots and displaying them in windows or balconies became a way to try and project a sense of belonging to higher classes to which they aspired. In other words, as the century wore on, the iconic flower became a visual marker for the lower classes’ (often awkward) attempts to convey a social standing superior to their own. Naturally, such attempts rarely landed in the way they were intended, and before long, horticulturalists began to look down on the _Pelargonium_ with a certain derision. Gertrude Jekyll writes in 1919 that, “It is a common thing for friends to express surprise at seeing scarlet Geraniums...in my garden, forgetting that it was not the fault of the plants that they were misused or employed in dull or even stupid ways.”[^ref23] His comments reveal that it was not the plants themselves that were particularly offensive to garden specialists; rather, it was the way they had been used by certain cack-handed individuals, presumably the lower classes, that made them such a subject of scorn in horticultural circles.

Partridge & Co, c. 1869. Children’s Book Collection. Library Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, UCLA.]">

As a result, the _Pelargonium_ at the turn of the century became a symbol for the working class’s ungainly attempts at propriety and a gauche lack of style–and it was instrumentalized as such throughout art and literature. Catherine Horwood notes that, “If there is one plant that sums up the attitude of Victorian sentimentalists towards the unfortunate working class in the nineteenth century, it is the forlorn red ‘geranium’ sitting on a cottage window-sill. Hundreds of artists used this as a symbol of aspirations to respectability.”[^ref24] With this context, we might understand Kirkland’s pretensions to the “genteel _Geranium_” as an ironic statement, more in line with the OED’s definition of “genteel” as “being characteristic of those who are possessed with a dread of being taken for ‘common people’, or who attach exaggerated importance to supposed marks of social superiority...in educated language it has always a sarcastic or at least playful colouring,” than to assertions of true gentility.[^ref25]

<![endif]--> The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, specifically in Paris. As part of a massive project to urbanize Paris, overseen by Emperor Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann, architects designed new parks, gardens, squares, and promenades and oversaw the revitalization of existing green spaces with fresh plantings.[^ref26] In his book _[Les Promenades de Paris](http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/001173612/catalog)_, Adolphe Alphand inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees selected by him and others to beautify the city.[^ref27] Needless to say, they chose many different types of showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for mass-producing them. Although Alphand’s book primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too.[^ref28] The French-bred pelargoniums, which retained some of their exotic associations with Southern Africa, served as live manifestations of the global reach of the French Empire and its colonial agenda especially because the plants were then propagated in French Algiers to produce fragrant oils.

In 1847, the French perfume industries of Grasse, including the company of Léon Chiris Léopold Chiris? , introduced the pelargonium to Algeria in order to cultivate and produce aromatic oil from it. Algeria was considered an ideal place for doing so due to its warm arid and semi-arid climate and the low cost of colonial labor needed for the "preparation and planting of cuttings, weeding of fields, harvesting of the material to be distilled."[^ref28] Perfumers selected pelargoniums because most species have a sweet aroma similar to roses. Such oils are extracted by [distillation](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/viewer/1e1gx/Distillation-process?_ga=2.191538920.352386283.1596674591-989112353.1594909187) and the substances that evaporate and condense again are taken from the leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits and seeds of the plant.

The Chiris company introduced a particular pelargonium hybrid, "_Geranium rosat_," to Boufarik, Algeria, selecting "a trentaine of wild Pelargonium species, from cells that are found most frequently in the Cap de Bonne Espérance region."[^ref29] That selection allowed the Chiris establishments to earn a stable profit. In 1865, Chiris built a 3,000 square meter factory in the Saint-Marguerite domain in Boufarik, which was first acquired in 1836. Its production was centered on _Pelargoniums_, orange trees, and other aromatic plants. However, the headquarters in Boufarik closed once it was nationalized in 1963, as did the other headquarters in the former European colonies.

Today, pelargonium oil continues to be industrially produced in factories across the globe, most notably in Egypt and China.[^ref30] Significantly, the confusion surrounding pelargonium nomenclature in Europe contexts also exists in China. More than 50% of Chinese packaging uses “Geranium Essential Oil” as its English translation, even though the product is labeled as _Tianzhu Kui You (Pelargonium Oil)_ in Chinese. It is said that the name _Tianzhu Kui_ was introduced by Junyu Zhang in 1933 based on his studies in Japan. The word _Tianzhu Kui_ is from _ゼラニウム_, which is pronounced as _Geranium_ in English.

### Conclusion

Although the _Pelargonium_ by any other name would smell as sweet, our recognition of its unique identity is long overdue. Indeed, the _Pelargonium_’s almost-forgotten global history extremely rich blossoming as it does at the intersections of colonial trade, botany, agriculture, gardening, art, culture, and industry. Telling the story of the _Pelargonium_ as an entity separate from the _Geranium_, illuminates just some of the many ways in which it has been interwoven with human histories – hiding in plain sight, as it were, by virtue of its long-persisting misnomer.
