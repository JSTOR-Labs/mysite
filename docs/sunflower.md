_Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower) holds a special status in the plant kingdom. The species is among a small number of crop plants that humans first domesticated in North America thousands of years ago and the only one that is still widely used today.[^ref1] Indeed, domesticated sunflower is primarily grown as an oil seed crop, having been introduced from its native range in North America nearly worldwide. The cultivated annual is also a popular ornamental, renowned for its yellow flower head, large disk, heart-shaped or ovate leaves, unbranched stem, and imposing height. Remarkably, the plant can grow freestanding up to sixteen feet tall and [nearly twice that](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-sunflower) when supported.

Yet, as this botanical illustration reminds us, _Helianthus annuus_ also has an imposing presence in the visual arts. Like the supersized flower in this plant portrait, the domesticated sunflower looms large in many cultural imaginaries. So large, in fact, that we may be more familiar with sunflower imagery than with actual sunflowers. The proliferation of the flower in European art since the colonial period is due partly to the aesthetic appeal of traits artificially selected to increase seed production, a single bloom with a large disk, and partly to the timing of its introduction to Europe in the sixteenth century coincident with the flourishing of a new genre of botanical treatise known as the [florilegium](https://wordsmith.org/words/florilegium.html) ("collection of flowers").

Sunflower imagery can provide rich historical information about the genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2)_ and the roles of visual culture in communicating knowledges, myths, and meanings related to plants. Artists working in Europe and North America from the colonial to the modern period, produced likenesses of the sunflower that served aesthetic, imperial, scientific, commercial, and other functions. In doing so, they developed conventions for representing specific characteristics of sunflowers that were tailored to those aims. By tracking changes in that [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) over time, we can learn about the historical significance of sunflowers in specific temporal and geographic contexts, as well as shifts in the ways that humans have represented, encountered, used, studied, and valued them. Through that practice of close visual analysis, that engaging with artworks necessarily involves, we also cultivate a greater attentiveness to bring to our encounters with the plant world.

### Naming the Iconic Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q66425303" title="iconic">
The genus _Helianthus_—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—and the species _Helianthus annuus_ were named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, by which time the plant was already a beloved garden flower in Europe.[^ref2] Although it may be hard for us to imagine the extraordinary admiration for the sunflower at that time, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant, in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_ (1737), offers some insights. He asks, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?”[^ref3] His encomium on the splendor of a mature _Helianthus_ inflorescence and its formal resemblance to the sun demonstrates some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans prized and that make the flower, both real and represented, so iconic today.

The Spanish were likely the first Europeans to transport the domesticated sunflower from North America to Spain, though questions persist about who collected such live plants or seeds, and when and from where they did so.[^ref4] In the absence of more definitive evidence about their harvesting of _Helianthus annuus_, an exploitative practice now termed “[extraction colonialism](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2015/a-typology-of-colonialism),” we can use verbal and visual descriptions of the plant in early printed books to chart its introduction to Spain and other parts of Europe. It is worth noting that such books are not always reliable and should be consulted alongside correspondence, inventories, auction records, herbarium specimens, and other forms of evidence.

Once introduced to Spain, the domesticated sunflower quickly migrated to parts of Italy and the Low Countries via transregional trade routes.[^ref5] Networks of wealthy and privileged Europeans, most of who were men, exchanged plant materials for cultivating _Helianthus annuus_ and instructions for doing so in letters and drawings. This model visualizes some connections among a group of proto botanists, patrons, publishers, artists, and members of royal courts who, through their epistolary and direct interactions, exchanged information about the cultivated sunflower that was published in herbals and florilegia during the 1560s and 1570s.

In the 1610s, Basilius Besler oversaw the production of this print, which established some visual conventions for representing the domesticated sunflower. Besler was commissioned by Prince Bishop of Eichstätt to oversee the creation of a florilegium, entitled _[Hortus Eystettensis](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10908)_, documenting the contents of his garden in Bavaria.[^ref6] This hand-colored [engraving](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary) portrays a specimen thought to have been grown there. The portrait depicts the plant shown life-sized. The image’s impact derives not only from its impressive dimensions, but also from its bold cruciform composition, which imbues the full flower head and stem with a sense of power. A symmetrical design makes the flower’s disk spiral a focal point around which irregular ray florets lend rhythm and heart-shaped leaves decorative flourish. These formal strategies were innovative for the time because they celebrated the sunflower’s beauty above its use value, unlike most illustrations then found in herbals. For that reason, Besler’s _Flos Solis maior_ became an influential model for visualizing _H. annuus_ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristanmhanson/plant-humanities/develop/images/Sunflower%20emoji_openmoji.org_tiny.jpg){: .right}
that anticipated modern visual stereotypes for the plant, perhaps best epitomized by this sunflower emoji.

The migration of sunflower iconography from Besler’s _Hortus Eystettensis_  to other sources is evidenced in the pages of Francisco Hernández’s _[Nova plantarum](https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.136937)_, published posthumously in 1651. The book purports to document plants and animals that Hernández and his team, which included several indigenous artists, observed during a three-year expedition through New Spain (present-day Mexico) in the 1570s.[^ref7] However, its illustrations of sunflowers, shown here, were not drawn on-site from local flora but rather borrowed from European models. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,130,569,546">The upper one</span> was adapted directly or through intermediary sources from the sunflower portrait _Flos Solis maior_ made under Besler’s direction.

These appropriations have been interpreted as evidence that Hernández’s team of artists or those working on his manuscript at a later date had to copy existing imagery because the sunflower was not established in New Spain at the time of his expedition.[^ref8] If that were so, Hernández’s discussion of the sunflower implied a mythic encounter with the plant, reproducing European misconceptions about its range that modern scientists later disputed.

Although modern-day botanists consulted herbals and other historical evidence to chart the movement of cultivated _Helianthus annuus_, they also revolutionized the field by using distribution maps and fossilized remains to study the origins of the plant.[^ref9] The earliest known cultivated sunflower remains—charred seeds—tell us that humans used _H._ _annuus_ at [Hayes shelter](http://opencontext.org/subjects/9cdf1026-42cd-4903-820c-e7415ede8900) in central Tennessee by 5000 BP and parts of eastern North America by 3000 BP.[^ref10] It is likely that, in the pre-5000 BP context, Indigenous peoples transported wild sunflowers to their campsites, where the plants became stabilized and later cultivated to possess desirable traits, namely large flower heads with more seeds.[^ref11]

Although some scientists identified the seed as coming from _Helianthus annuus_, others argued that it may have come from a bottle gourd.[^ref13] Expanding on that archeological research, genomic studies of modern domesticated and wild sunflowers have linked the plants to a single common ancestor, which was cultivated at an independent domestication center, along with pepo squash, marsh elder, and chenopod, in <span data-click-map-flyto="37.347878, -89.590292">eastern North America</span>.[^ref14] For those reasons, botanists have argued that domesticated _H. annuus_ was brought to Mexico via North American trade routes, possibly by Spanish colonizers.[^ref15]

By the early 1630s, when Anthony Van Dyck painted _Self-Portrait with Sunflower_, at right, there was a well-established iconography in Europe for representing the aesthetic qualities of sunflowers. Van Dyck, a Flemish artist then working for Charles I of England, surely had numerous models to study such as imagery in herbals, florilegia, and emblems.[^ref16] In this self-portrait, the artist portrays him likeness wearing an opulent gold chain gifted by the king in order to identify his position as a royal portraitist and member of the court. He also devotes nearly a third of the composition to describing the pert head and robust foliage of a blooming golden sunflower—a floral manifestation of his loyalty to his patron.

Europeans associated sunflowers with the human sentiments of loyalty and constancy because the plant's heliotropic phase recalled how, in an ancient Greek myth, the sea nymph Clytie expressed her devotion to the sun-god Helios.[^ref17] According to the story, Clytie competed unsuccessfully for Helios's affections. Scorned by him and shunned by her fellow nymphs, Clytie wasted away, wholly consumed with gazing upon his chariot as it traversed the sky. Her suffering ended with her metamorphosis into a heliotrope, so named for its flowers' movement toward the sun's rays. Yet, as this print shows, some European artists, particularly those active in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, reinterpreted the narrative by recasting the heliotrope as a sunflower.[^ref18] That break with conventions demonstrates the fashionability of the sunflower as a motif, and the degree to which it was entangled not only with beliefs about the flower's formal resemblance to the sun but also with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic.

There is a longstanding cultural assumption that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena.[^ref19] Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement. These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, botanical illustrators developed a refined iconography for representing cultivated sunflowers that allowed them to communicate scientific knowledge about the plant. This hand-colored print _Anatomy of the Sunflower_, designed by [Peter Henderson](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500042021), exemplifies a mode of artistic engagement with plants tailored to the needs of botanists. Henderson’s image shows a partial view of two mature plants—facing opposite directions—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures. Yet Henderson takes some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality, expanding the appeal of the illustration beyond scientists to plant and art collectors as well. <span data-click-image-zoomto="982,2706,2213,1795">At the center of the left flower,</span> a series of green scallop-like shapes describe how bracts, or modified leaves, grow in concentric layers.

Henderson's botanical illustration highlights a trait of sunflowers that we may overlook due to our casual familiarity with the plant. Its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets.[^ref20] This diagram of a mature flower head shows that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets, which are sterile and serve to attract pollinators to disk florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own fruit after pollination. Perceiving such floral traits and examining their functions requires a process of direct observation and visual analysis akin to making and studying artistic representations of plants.

Henderson’s design for _Anatomy of the Sunflower_ models that sort of attentiveness to the plant world while also articulating Linnaeus’s contributions to botany as they relate to _Helianthus_. Linnaeus developed a plant taxonomy that he based on the number, arrangement, and similarities of reproductive organs: stamen(s) and pistil(s). The tremendous influence of this system on the production of knowledge about and portrayal of plants is evident in the <span data-click-image-zoomto="2992,4439,1952,1782">lower right corner of _Anatomy of the Sunflower_,</span> where there are precise depictions of such organs. This series of details was essential to the function of the picture; it was commissioned by Dr. Robert John Thornton for his book _[New illustration of the sexual system of Carolus von Linnaeus](http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990075420710203941/catalog)_.

In the later-nineteenth century, many European painters embraced the genre of still life to explore the expressive capacities of paint, plants, and floral forms. Indeed, Vincent van Gogh cultivated a signature style of representing domesticated sunflowers in which he emphasizes color and texture. In this 1888 painting, entitled _Sunflowers_, he uses a range of intense yellows to depict an arrangement of more than a dozen blooms. The disparate hues and shapes of their radiant ocher, mustard, and golden-orange flower heads indicate that two different types of cultivated _Helianthus annuus_ are portrayed here and that they were harvested at different stages of their life cycles. The sunflowers, <span data-click-image-zoomto="9,1135,1311,1118">at top left</span> and center, have shed ray florets and started to wilt, whereas many of their plush counterparts—a double-flowered variety known as the <span data-click-image-zoomto="2050,113,1311,1118">"Teddy Bear"</span>—are still vibrant.[^ref21] Van Gogh painted <span data-click-image-zoomto="-1158,0,7037,6001">these sunflowers</span> directly from life during the summer of 1888, after moving from Paris to Arles the previous winter.[^ref22] We can therefore read his gold palette as metaphorically evoking the bright warm light of southern France that nurtured his painting practice and the growth of the sunflowers shown here.

Contrary to what is most often portrayed in visual and verbal descriptions of sunflowers, the palette of _Helianthus_ is not limited to yellow. Indeed, there are more than fifty accepted species grouped under _Helianthus_ and many cultivars, and

their flowers' color can range from gold to orange to red to dark purple and even an unexpected shade of pink. Species also vary in terms of size and the number and shape of their leaves and flower heads, as demonstrated by these herbarium sheets with dried _Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower), _Helianthus giganteus_ (giant sunflower), and _Helianthus tuberosus_ (Jerusalem artichoke or sunchoke). The specimens also dispel the false notion that all sunflowers only have one large blossom per stock. That trait, as we now know, is unique to the domesticated sunflower and due to human selection.

Sunflower seeds also exhibit variations in size, color, and markings. Whole seeds–comprised of a kernel and a husk–can be solid black or gray and have a stripe pattern. The Hopi tribe of Native Americans have cultivated sunflowers with deep purple seeds, that appear black and shiny, in the southwest for hundreds of years.[^ref23] They use these seeds to produce dark blue or purple dyes for coloring wools and vegetal fibers that are in turn used to make [weavings or baskets](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/american-indian-film-archive/hopi-arts-and-crafts?path=hopi-southwest-indians). The processes of cultivating, harvesting, and boiling seeds to produce dye for basketry are examples of a rich tradition of tribal plant knowledge that is interwoven with cultural and spiritual beliefs. Indigenous peoples of North America also [use(d) sunflowers in a variety of ways](http://naeb.brit.org/uses/search/?string=sunflower) including as a source of food, fuel, pigment, and medicine, as well as ceremonially.

### Gone to Seed

Visual representations of sunflowers have shaped and been shaped by human interactions with the plant world. By analyzing that imagery, we can become more attuned to the significance of human-plant encounters and our own engagements with plants. That kind of attentive regard for plants is essential if we are to enter into sustainable relationships with them and prevent further environmental degradation. This 1887 painting by Van Gogh, entitled _Sunflowers_, reminds us just what is at stake. The [memento mori](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/m/memento-mori)  shows two cut flower heads that have gone to seed—<span data-click-image-zoomto="819,696,1798,1533">a dried disk with exposed kernels</span> nestles up against <span data-click-image-zoomto="2097,480,1798,1533">a desiccated yellow husk</span>, both rest on a somber though <span data-click-image-zoomto="151,-153,3595,3065">tactile blue ground</span>. The artist’s defamiliarization of sunflower iconography unsettles our tendency to assume that plants are infinitely replenishable. For that reason, we can read the floral remains as a mournful reminder of our withered or exploitative relationship to nature, although it would be more productive to interpret them in a positive light, as an invitation to cultivate connections to plants that attend to their intrinsic values as living organisms.
