### A Giant among Us

<param ve-entity eid="Q171497" aliases="Helianthus annuus" title="sunflower"> 
_Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower) holds a special status in the plant kingdom due to its relationship with humans. The species is among a small number of crop plants that humans domesticated in North America thousands of years ago.[^ref1] Today, the annual is cultivated nearly worldwide for its edible seeds and seed oil. _H. annuus_ is also a popular ornamental, renowned for its yellow flower head, round disk, heart-shaped leaves, unbranched stem, and imposing height. Indeed, the plant can grow freestanding up to sixteen feet tall.

Yet, as this botanical illustration reminds us, _Helianthus annuus_ has an imposing presence not just in the plant world but also in the art world. Like that plant portrait’s supersized flower, _H. annuus_ looms large in some cultural imaginaries, so large that many of us fail to appreciate the intrinsic value of the species and to recognize the diversity within the genus sunflower. Instead, for those of us without direct knowledge of such plants, it is all too easy to essentialize sunflowers by assuming that they all possess a single, golden blossom perched on an unbranched stem. Such stereotypes have often shaped or been shaped by visual representations of the plant.

This essay clarifies how sunflower imagery can provide rich historical information about the genus and the roles of visual culture in communicating knowledges, myths, and meanings related to plants. Artists working in Europe and America from the colonial period to the present day, produced likenesses of the sunflower that served aesthetic, scientific, commercial, and other functions. Although such artists developed conventions for representing sunflowers that were tailored to those aims, they consistently engaged with cultural beliefs about the flower’s formal resemblance to the sun and, less often so, with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic. These trends in [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) have contributed to the formation of visual stereotypes for the sunflower that often elide species differences and perpetuate cultural myths.

### Naming and Representing the Iconic Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q10432667306" title="Carl Linnaeus" aliases="Carolus Linnaeus">
The genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2)_—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—was named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, by which time the plant was already a beloved garden flower in Europe.[^ref2] Although it may be hard for us to imagine the extraordinary admiration for the sunflower at that time, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant, in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_, offers some insights. He asks, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?”[^ref3] His encomium on the splendor of the mature _Helianthus_ inflorescence demonstrates some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans prized and that make the flower, both real and represented, so iconic today.

Although Linnaeus gave _Helianthus_ and _Helianthus annuus_ their botanical names, it is arguable that Basilius Besler, who oversaw the production of the print, at right, helped to establish some visual conventions for representing the sunflower. A team of artists, etchers, printmakers, and colorists, hired by Besler, produced this hand-tinted [engraving](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary) of _H. annuus_, a striking depiction of the plant shown life-sized.[^ref4] The image’s impact derives not only from its impressive dimensions, but also from its bold cruciform composition, which imbues the full flower head and stem with a sense of power. A symmetrical design makes the flower’s disk spiral a focal point around which irregular ray florets lend rhythm and heart-shaped leaves decorative flourish. These formal strategies were innovative for the time because they emphasized the sunflower’s beauty rather than its medicinal properties, as in herbals. For that reason,  _Flos Solis maior_ became an influential model for visualizing the sunflower that anticipated current visual stereotypes for the plant.

### Range and Cultivation

<param ve-entity eid="Q495448" title="Marshall County" aliases="central Tennessee">
So, how did the _Helianthus annuus_ specimen represented in _Flos Solis maior_ come into being? The common sunflower was cultivated by humans thousands of years ago, and the history of that process is enmeshed with convergences of plant and human mobility. We can chart that movement by using maps to study the locations associated with plant distribution, fossilized remains, and other forms of evidence.[^ref5] The earliest known sunflower remains—charred seeds—tell us that humans used _H._ _annuus_ at [Hayes shelter](http://opencontext.org/subjects/9cdf1026-42cd-4903-820c-e7415ede8900) in central Tennessee by 5000 BP and parts of eastern North America by 3000 BP.[^ref6] It is likely that, in the pre-5000 BP context, indigenous peoples transported wild sunflowers to their campsites, where the plants became stabilized and later cultivated to possess favorable traits, such as large seeds.

<param ve-entity eid="Q80914" title="Tabasco">
There is some debate among scientists about when humans used domesticated sunflowers in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, and whether they were cultivated independently there.[^ref7]  A charred seed, which is no longer extant, was recovered at San Antonio cave, in Tabasco, Mexico. Although some scientists identified the seed as coming from _H. annuus_, others argued that the seed it may have come from a squash or a wild sunflower. Building on that and other archeological research, genomic studies of the common sunflower have linked present-day crops and seed remains to a common ancestor, which was cultivated at an independent domestication center in eastern North America. For those reasons, several botanists have argued that _H. annuus_ was brought to Mexico via North American trade routes, possibly even by Spanish explorers.

The Spanish first transported the domesticated sunflower across the Atlantic Ocean, though questions persist about who collected such plants or seeds, and when and from where they did so. In the absence of more specific evidence about their harvesting of the domesticated sunflower, an exploitative practice now termed “[extraction colonialism](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2015/a-typology-of-colonialism),” verbal and visual descriptions of the plant in herbals help us to chart its introduction to Spain and other parts of Europe.

### “Peruvian” Origins and Mythic Encounters

<param ve-entity eid="Q2094286" title="Petrus van der Borcht">
The illustration of a sunflower in Dodoens’s _Florum, et coronariarum_, at right, helps us to chart the transoceanic movement of the plant. The [woodcut](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary), designed by Petrus van der Borcht, depicts a mature _Helianthus annuus_ plant growing in soil as the artist may have encountered it in a garden. Indeed, Dodoens’s identifies the place shown in the picture where he and the artist presumably studied the plant in bloom: “They call this plant the ‘Sun of India’ (or ‘Indian Sun’) because it so resembles a sun surrounded by rays. We saw this plant in the delightful garden abundant with any variety of plants belonging to the excellent and worthy Johannes Brancio…. You may seek it in vain elsewhere, only to find it in his garden.” Beautiful to behold, according to Dodoens, the sunflower was a rare foreign luxury good that conferred status upon its owner, though it was also a living artifact of European colonialist policies that were entangled with economic exploitation and violence. Not surprisingly, sources are not often forthcoming about those aspects of plant harvesting and there are gaps in our knowledge about the collection of cultivated sunflowers in the Americas.

<param ve-entity eid="Q419" title="Peru">
Dodoens account of the cultivated sunflower’s provenance is somewhat muddy. He used the pre-Linnaean name _Chrysanthemum Peruvianum_ to indicate mistakenly that the plant was native to Peru. However, at that time, Europeans herbalists often used the word “Peru” indiscriminately to mean someplace in the Americas. This misunderstanding about the sunflower’s “Peruvian” origins was propagated in subsequent herbals that repurposed imagery and information from Dodoens. That was the case for John Gerard's _[The herball](https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.7107)_ (1578), which reproduces the woodcut of _Chrysanthemum Peruvianum_ from Dodoens’s _Florum, et coronariarum_.

Dodoens participated in a network of transregional European exchanges of iconography and ideas related to the sunflower. This visualization posits a preliminary model for studying points of intersection among Dodoens and authors, artists, translators, plant collectors, patrons, and other figures, active in Europe between the 1550s and the 1650s. The web of interactions also shows some instances in which illustrations of sunflowers—_Flos Solis maior_, _Flos Solis minor_, and _Chrysanthemum Peruvianum_—migrated from one herbal to another, possibly through intermediary sources. These borrowings raise questions about the significance of individual plants and pictures, about relationships of images to texts, about patterns of artistic exchange, and about the role of iconography in processes of knowledge production.

The migration of sunflower iconography is evidenced in Francisco Hernández’s _[Nova plantarum](https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.136937)_ (1651). The book purports to document plants and animals that Hernández and his team, which included several indigenous artists, observed during a three-year expedition through Mexico in the 1570s. However, its illustrations of sunflowers, shown here, were not drawn on-site from local plants but rather borrowed from European models. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,130,569,546">The upper one</span> was adapted directly or through intermediary sources from the sunflower portrait made under Besler’s direction for inclusion in _[Hortus Eystettensis](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10908)_ (1613). <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,554,570,546">The lower one</span> repurposes a design from a 1619 French-language translation of a text by Monardes, or a similar precedent. These borrowings have been interpreted as evidence that Hernández’s team of artists had to copy existing imagery because the sunflower was not established in Mexico at the time. If that were so, Hernández’s inclusion of the sunflower in his manuscript reproduced European misconceptions about its range, demonstrating the importance of consulting a broad range of sources when interpreting the information in herbals.

Europeans were eager to collect exotic flora from the Americas because such plants were highly valued for their medicinal and culinary properties, in addition to being prized as foreign curiosities, luxury goods, and status symbols. Sunflowers, like other flora, also became associated with a mythical lexicon, known as the language of flowers, that imbued specific plants with human sentiments. _Helianthus annuus_ carried connotations of devotion, loyalty, and constancy because its heliotropic phase recalled the ancient Greek myth of Helios and Clytie. The sea nymph Clytie competed unsuccessfully for the heart of the sun-god Helios. Scorned by him, Clytie wastes away while training her steadfast gaze upon his chariot as it traverses the sky. Her suffering ends with her metamorphosis into a heliotrope. Yet, as this print shows, many seventeenth-century European artists reinterpreted the myth by transforming Clytie’s attribute from a heliotrope into a more fashionable plant: the sunflower.

<param ve-entity eid="Q1602587" title="heliotropism" aliases="heliotropic">
It is widely believed that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and, once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena, publishing their exciting findings in 2016. Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement.

These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages, too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation. Needles to say, these exciting findings generated a media buzz!

### Out of One, Many

Our familiarity with the sunflower, both real and represented, may lead us to overlook the fact that its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets. This diagram of a mature flower head shows that its disk consists of florets and that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own seed after pollination. Although these traits may come as a surprise to us, botanical illustrators developed an iconography to communicate information about them in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Henderson shows a partial view of two mature plants—one facing back, and the other nearly front—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures, while taking some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality. <span data-click-image-zoomto="982,2706,2213,1795">At the center of the left flower,</span> a series of green scallop- and flame-like shapes describe how bracts, or modified leaves, grow in concentric layers. Their slight curvature contrasts with a leaf that curls exuberantly away from the plant’s stem, leading the eye to <span data-click-image-zoomto="1448,813,4149,3588">the opposite flower.</span> Rust-orange “petals,” some with gold highlights, radiate outward from its dark-brown disk. <span data-click-image-zoomto="3200,1997,1038,897">A close look at the disk</span> reveals a circular band composed of stylized representations of yellow, five-petaled florets. These details remind us that the study of art and flora are endeavors rooted in the practices of direct observation and visual analysis.

<param ve-entity eid="Q62779" title="pistil" aliases="pistil(s)">  Henderson’s design for _Anatomy of the Sunflower_ also articulates Linnaeus’s contributions to botany as they relate to _Helianthus_. Linnaeus developed a plant taxonomy that he based on the number, arrangement, and similarities of reproductive organs: stamen(s) and pistil(s). The tremendous influence of this system on the production of knowledge about and portrayal of plants is evident in the <span data-click-image-zoomto="2992,4439,1952,1782">lower right corner of _Anatomy of the Sunflower_,</span> where there are precise depictions of such organs. This series of details was essential to the function of the picture; it was commissioned by Dr. Robert John Thornton for his book _[New illustration of the sexual system of Carolus von Linnaeus](http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990075420710203941/catalog)_.

### Sun-Shaped though Not Necessarily Golden

We may also be surprised to discover the diversity within the genus _Helianthus_. Indeed, there are more than fifty accepted species grouped under Helianthus and, contrary to what is often portrayed in images and texts, their palette is not limited to yellow.

 Their color can range from gold to orange to red and even an unexpected shade of pink. Species also vary in terms of size and the number and shape of their leaves and flower heads, as demonstrated by these herbarium sheets with dried _Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower), _Helianthus giganteus_ (giant sunflower), and _Helianthus tuberosus_ (Jerusalem artichoke or sunchoke). The specimens also dispel the notion that sunflowers only have one large blossom per stock.

Hopi—black sunflower. Indigenous peoples of North America use(d) the plant in a variety of ways including as a source of food, fuel, pigment, dye, and medicine, as well as ceremonially. More specifically, some artists incorporate the sunflower—as a motif and a material—into their work using practices that evidence tribal plant knowledges, while also communicating cultural and spiritual beliefs related to that flower or the sun. The Hopi tribe grow a sunflower with black seeds that is used to dye natural fibers for making tapestry weavings and baskets.

Still life paintings provide another rich source of evidence regarding plant diversity, conveying information that cannot be preserved on herbarium sheets. Claude Monet's _Jerusalem artichoke_ presents an impression of _Helianthus tuberosus_ in which he studies how the eye perceives its color and form, whereas Vincent van Gogh's _Sunflowers_ engages with the tactile and emotive aspects of _Helianthus annuus_ by juxtaposing typical blossoms and double-flower mutants. The pictures not only show us different species, but also model for us a kind of aesthetic and phenomenological attentiveness to the plant world to which we ought to aspire.

As this map shows, the native range of _Helianthus_ stretches from British Columbia to southwest Mexico, though the plant has been introduced nearly worldwide. Of the two images in Hernández’s _Nova plantarum_, the one adapted from Besler’s _Hortus Eystettensis_ resembles what would become a visual cliché for representing the plant in other contexts.
