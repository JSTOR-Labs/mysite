Sunflowers hold a special status in the natural world. Highly valued for their edible seeds and seed oil, they are one of the few crop plants to have originated in North America. They are also popular ornamentals, renowned for their yellow flower heads with round disks and, in some cases, imposing height. Indeed, in cultivation _Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower) can grow up to sixteen feet tall, towering over us and other organisms. Yet, despite the relatively widespread cultivation of the sunflower and its iconic formal qualities, myths about the genus persist and these ideas have often shaped or been shaped by visual representations of the plant.

European, American, and Native American portrayals of the sunflower can provide valuable historical information about the plant and about the role of visual culture in communicating knowledges, myths, and meanings related to it. Artists, working from the European colonial period to the present day, produced likenesses of the sunflower that often fulfilled scientific, aesthetic, ceremonial, commercial, and other functions. Although such artists developed conventions for representing the plant that were tailored to those aims, they consistently engaged with cultural beliefs about the flower’s formal resemblance to the sun and, less often so, with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic. These trends in [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) helped to perpetuate several myths about sunflowers that are still held today, while sometimes also serving to uphold, challenge, or illuminate stereotypes pertaining to societal markers of difference.

### Naming and Representing the Iconic Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q10432667306" title="Carl Linnaeus">
The genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2)_—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—was named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, by which time the plant was already a beloved garden flower in Europe. Although it may be hard for us to imagine the popularity of the sunflower at that time, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant, in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_, offers some insights. He writes, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?” His encomium on the splendor of the mature _Helianthus_ inflorescence demonstrates some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans admired and that make the flower so iconic today.

Although Linnaeus gave _Helianthus_ and _H. annuus_ their official botanical names, it is arguable that Basilius Besler, who oversaw the production of the print, at right, helped to establish some visual conventions for representing the sunflower that are still influential. A team of artists, etchers, printmakers, and colorists, working under Besler’s direction, produced the hand-tinted engraving of _H. annuus_, which presents a striking vision of the plant shown life-sized. The image’s impact derives not only from its impressive dimensions, but also from its bold cruciform composition, which imbues the full flower head and stock with a sense of power. A symmetrical design makes the flower’s disk spiral a focal point around which irregular ray florets lend rhythm and heart-shaped leaves decorative flourish. Those formal strategies were innovative for the time because they described the sunflower’s beauty rather than its medicinal or culinary properties, as in herbals. For those reasons, the portrait became an influential model for visualizing sunflower aesthetics.

### Range and Cultivation

The history of the sunflower  is enmeshed with mobility that can be charted through the study of plant remains and visual representations, among other sources. The earliest known sunflower remains—charred seeds—tell us that humans used domesticated _Helianthus_ in central Tennessee by 5000 BP and parts of eastern North America by 3000 BP. It is likely that, in the pre-5000 BP context, humans transported wild sunflowers to their campsites, where they became stabilized and later cultivated. That movement was central to plant cultivation and evolution through processes of human selection. Still, there is some debate about when domesticated sunflowers were used in present-day Mexico, and whether the plant was cultivated there independently from North America.

<param ve-entity eid="Q950531" aliases="Nicolas Monardes" title="Nicolás Monardes"> 
Botanical illustrations allow us to map the introduction of the sunflower from the Americas to Europe during the colonial period. The Spanish, who arrived in the Americas in 1492, were the first to transport sunflower seeds overseas to Europe. Indeed, the Spanish physician and botanist Nicolas Monardes was the first European to describe the sunflower. He based that description, in his _Dos Libros_ (1565), on plants that were grown at his botanical garden at Seville. The book was translated into English _[Joyfull Newes out of the Newe Founde Worlde](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/7770654)_ first published in 1577. Another publication based on Monardes was Francisco Hernández's _Rerum medicarum Novae Hispaniae_.
<param ve-image iiif url="https://ia802806.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?id=rerummedicarumno00hern&itemPath=%2F18%2Fitems%2Frerummedicarumno00hern&server=ia802806.us.archive.org&page=n273_w584" title="Hernández, Francisco, _Rerum medicarum Novae Hispaniae_, The Getty Research Institute">

The Spanish, like other Europeans, eagerly collected exotic flora from the Americas because such plants were highly valued for their medicinal and culinary properties, in addition to being foreign curiosities and status symbols. That practice of “collecting” natural resources, known as [extractive colonialism](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2015/a-typology-of-colonialism), often involved violent confrontations with indigenous inhabitants. The cover of What, at right, shows what though offers no indication of such encounters.

Rembert Dodoens produced the first book, in _[Florum, et coronariarum](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48323400)_, that contained an illustration of the plant. That woodcut, shown at right and designed by Petrus van der Borcht, depicts a mature _Helianthus annuus_ as one might encounter it in a garden. The visual representation robust stock, heart-shaped leaves, a single flower head per stock.

The provenance of the sunflowers grown in Eichstätt’s garden and the history the genus _Helianthus_ can be traced back to North  America. As this map shows, the native range of _Helianthus_ stretches from British Columbia to southwest Mexico. The radiant plant portrait was made for inclusion in the florilegium _[Hortus Eystettensis](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10908)_, a monumental book commissioned by Prince Bishop of Eichstätt to catalog the flowers in his garden.
The sunflower depicted in Besler’s _Hortus Eystettensis_ was drawn from plants cultivated in Eichstätt, Bavaria, in the 1600s. Those flowers were likely obtained through the Spanish who collected them from Central or South America—regions to which the sunflower was introduced by Native North Americans.

### Out of One, Many

<param ve-entity eid="Q14847254" title="Compositae"> 
<param ve-entity eid="Q30765614" title="floret"> 
Our familiarity with the sunflower, both real and represented, may lead us to overlook the fact that its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets. This diagram of a mature flower head shows that its disk consists of florets and that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own seed after pollination. Although these traits may come as a surprise to us, botanical illustrators developed an iconography to communicate information about them in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

This hand-colored print _Anatomy of the Sunflower_, based on a design by the artist Peter Henderson, exemplifies a sophisticated understanding of the plant. Henderson shows a partial view of two mature plants—one facing back, and the other nearly front—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures, while taking some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality. At the center of the left flower, a series of green scallop- and flame-like shapes describe how bracts, or modified leaves, grow in concentric layers. Their slight curvature contrasts with a leaf that curls exuberantly away from the plant’s stem, leading the eye to the opposite flower. Rust-orange “petals,” some with gold highlights, radiate outward from its dark-brown disk. A close look at the disk reveals a circular band composed of stylized representations of yellow, five-petaled florets. These details remind us that the study of art and flora are endeavors rooted in the practices of direct observation and visual analysis.

Henderson’s design for _Anatomy of the Sunflower_ also articulates Linnaeus’s contributions to botany as they relate to _Helianthus_. Linnaeus developed a plant taxonomy that he based on the number, arrangement, and similarities of reproductive organs: stamen(s) and pistil(s). The tremendous influence of this system on the production of knowledge about and portrayal of plants is evident in the lower right corner of Anatomy of the Sunflower, where there are precise depictions of such organs. This series of details was essential to the function of the picture; it was commissioned by Dr. Robert John Thornton for his book _[New illustration of the sexual system of Carolus von Linnaeus](http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990075420710203941/catalog)_. Thornton’s “new” book was distinct from an earlier publication on Linnaeus by John Miller, whose print _Helianthus annuus_ served as the inspiration for or shared the same model as Henderson’s.

We may also be surprised to discover the diversity within the genus _Helianthus_. Indeed, there are more than fifty accepted species grouped under Helianthus and, contrary to what is often portrayed in images and texts, their palette is not limited to yellow.
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Sunflower_%22Strawberry_Blonde%22_%283931552086%29.jpg/319px-Sunflower_%22Strawberry_Blonde%22_%283931552086%29.jpg){: .right}
 Their color can range from gold to orange to red and even an unexpected shade of pink. Species also vary in terms of size and the number and shape of their leaves and flower heads, as demonstrated by these herbarium sheets with dried _Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower), _Helianthus giganteus_ (giant sunflower), and _Helianthus tuberosus_ (Jerusalem artichoke or sunchoke). The specimens also dispel the notion that sunflowers only have one large blossom per stock.

Still life paintings provide another rich source of evidence regarding plant diversity, conveying information that cannot be preserved on herbarium sheets. Claude Monet's _Jerusalem artichoke_ presents an impression of _Helianthus tuberosus_ in which he studies how the eye perceives its color and form, whereas Vincent van Gogh's _Sunflowers_ engages with the tactile and emotive aspects of _Helianthus annuus_ by juxtaposing typical blossoms and double-flower mutants. The pictures not only show us different species, but also model for us a kind of aesthetic and phenomenological attentiveness to the plant world to which we ought to aspire.

### “I’ll Follow the Sun”: Heliotropism as Myth and Metaphor

<param ve-entity eid="Q1602587" title="heliotropism" aliases="heliotropic">
Having dispelled several cultural myths about the sunflower, we now turn to another. It is widely believed that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and, once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena, publishing their exciting findings in 2016.Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement. These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages, too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation. Widespread coverage of those findings by the media no doubt generated new excitement about the plant in recent years.

Heliotropism in plants was observed by the ancient Greeks and this phenomenon is a central conceit in the myth of Clytie and Helios. Explain the myth.

Indigenous peoples of North America use(d) the plant in a variety of ways including as a source of food, fuel, pigment, dye, and medicine, as well as ceremonially. More specifically, some artists incorporate the sunflower—as a motif and a material—into their work using practices that evidence tribal plant knowledges, while also communicating cultural and spiritual beliefs related to that flower or the sun. Diné (Navajo) artists incorporate sunflower motifs and sometimes pollen into sandpainting ceremonies. The Hopi tribe grow a sunflower with black seeds that is used to dye natural fibers for making tapestry weavings and baskets.
