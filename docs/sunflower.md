### A Giant among Us

<param ve-entity eid="Q171497" aliases="Helianthus annuus" title="sunflower"> 
_Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower) holds a special status in the plant kingdom. The species is among a small number of crop plants that humans domesticated in North America thousands of years ago.[^ref1] Today, the annual is cultivated nearly worldwide, mainly as a source of protein-rich seeds and seed oil. _H. annuus_ is also a popular ornamental, renowned for its yellow flower head, round disk, heart-shaped leaves, unbranched stem, and imposing height. Indeed, the plant can grow freestanding up to sixteen feet tall and nearly twice that when supported.[^ref2]

Yet, as this botanical illustration reminds us, _Helianthus annuus_ also has an imposing presence in the art world. Like the supersized flower in this plant portrait, _H. annuus_ looms large in many cultural imaginaries. So large, in fact, that we may be more familiar with sunflower imagery than with actual sunflowers.

Sunflower imagery can provide rich historical information about the genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2)_ and the roles of visual culture in communicating knowledges, myths, and meanings related to plants. Artists working in Europe and America from the colonial period to the present day, produced likenesses of the sunflower that served aesthetic, scientific, commercial, and other functions. In doing so, they developed conventions for representing specific characteristics of sunflowers that were tailored to those aims. By tracking changes in that [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) over time, we can learn about the historical significance of sunflowers in specific temporal and geographic contexts, as well as shifts in the ways that humans have represented, encountered, used, thought about, and valued the genus. Through that practice of close visual analysis, that engaging with artworks necessarily entails, we also cultivate a more attentive mode of being with plants.

### Naming the Iconic Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q10432667306" title="Carl Linnaeus" aliases="Carolus Linnaeus">
The genus Helianthus—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—was named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, by which time the plant was already a beloved garden flower in Europe.[^ref3] Although it may be hard for us to imagine the extraordinary admiration for the sunflower at that time, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant, in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_, offers some insights. He asks, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?”[^ref4] His encomium on the splendor of the mature _Helianthus_ inflorescence and its formal resemblance to the sun demonstrates some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans prized and that make the flower, both real and represented, so iconic today.

Europeans were eager to collect exotic flora from the Americas because such plants were highly valued for their medicinal and culinary properties, in addition to being foreign curiosities, status symbols, and treasures bound up with imperial expansion. The Spanish first transported the domesticated sunflower from North America to Europe, though questions persist about who collected such plants or seeds, and when and from where they did so. In the absence of more specific evidence about their harvesting of _Helianthus annuus_, an exploitative practice now termed “[extraction colonialism](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2015/a-typology-of-colonialism),” verbal and visual descriptions of the plant in herbals and florilegia, along with corroborating evidence, can be used to chart its introduction to <span data-click-map-flyto="45.796048, 3.108712">Spain</span> and other parts of Europe.

Nicolas Monardes’s _[Dos libros](https://archive.org/details/hin-wel-all-00002448-001)_ (1565) contains the first known published description of a sunflower written by a European. Monardes, who did not travel to the Americas, presumably authored the text in that herbal based on his observations of plants grown in his botanical garden in Sevilla, Spain.[^ref13] Monardes was primarily interested in the use of colonial trade routes to obtain "new" plants with healing and medicinal properties. However, the sunflower did not fit that paradigm and Europeans came to value the plant for its magnificent blooms and towering height. These qualities are described in Rembert Dodoens’s _[Florum, et coronariarum](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48323400)_ (1568)—one of the first books to reproduce an illustration of _H. annuus_. This early example of a florilegium, a treatise devoted to ornamental and aromatic flowers, also provides crucial evidence about when the cultivated sunflower was brought to a garden in <span data-click-map-flyto="51.031964, 4.502767">Mechelen</span>, Flanders.[^ref14]

### “Peruvian” Origins and Image Migration

<param ve-entity eid="Q2094286" title="Petrus van der Borcht">
The illustration of a sunflower in Dodoens’s _Florum, et coronariarum_, at right, contributed to the development of a visual language for portraying _Helianthus annuus_, in particular, and ornamentals, in general, that emphasized the aesthetic qualities of plants in full bloom. The [woodcut](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary), designed by Petrus van der Borcht, depicts a mature sunflower growing in soil as the artist may have encountered it displayed in a garden. Indeed, Dodoens’s identifies the place shown in the picture: “They call this plant the ‘Sun of India’ (or ‘Indian Sun’) because it so resembles a sun surrounded by rays. We saw this plant in the delightful garden abundant with any variety of plants belonging to the excellent and worthy Johannes Brancio…. You may seek it in vain elsewhere, only to find it in his garden.”[^ref15] Beautiful to behold, according to Dodoens, the sort of sunflower portrayed here was a rare foreign luxury good that conferred status upon its owner, though it was also a living artifact of European colonialist and imperialist agendas.

In the late 1500s, it was common for herbalists to appropriate illustrations and text from existing sources, adapting that material to new contexts. That was true of the sunflower imagery in Dodoens's _Florum, et coronariarum_.  In the following instances, the size of the illustrations were reduced to provide more space for text in keeping with the economical visual conventions and utilitarian function of herbals. Matthias de l'Obel reused the image in his herbal [Plantarum, seu, Stirpium historia](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/9871376) (1576). He named the plant “Solis Flos” and a small perennial sunflower “Solis Flos minor,” monikers that other authors would appropriate. By contrast, John Gerard's _[The herball](https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.7107)_ (1578) reproduced the image along with the pre-Linnaean name for the domesticated sunflower _Chrysanthemum Peruvianum_. It is important to note that, at the time, Dodoens and other European herbalists used the word “Peru” indiscriminately to mean someplace in the Americas.[^ref16] Despite there being no archaeological evidence to support the presence of _H. annuus_ in pre-colonial Peru, that muddied terminology has been misinterpreted as evidence of that flower's "Peruvian" origins.

### Sunflower Aesthetics in Full Bloom

Although Linnaeus gave _Helianthus_ and _Helianthus annuus_ their botanical names, it is arguable that Basilius Besler, who oversaw the production of the print, at right, helped to establish some visual conventions for representing the sunflower. A team of artists, etchers, printmakers, and colorists, hired by Besler, produced this hand-tinted [engraving](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary) of _H. annuus_, a striking depiction of the plant shown life-sized.[^ref5] The image’s impact derives not only from its impressive dimensions, but also from its bold cruciform composition, which imbues the full flower head and stem with a sense of power. A symmetrical design makes the flower’s disk spiral a focal point around which irregular ray florets lend rhythm and heart-shaped leaves decorative flourish. These formal strategies were innovative for the time because they celebrated the sunflower’s beauty above its use value. For that reason, Besler’s _Flos Solis maior_ (“giant flower of the sun”) became an influential model for visualizing _H. annuus_ that anticipates modern visual stereotypes for the plant.

Through transregional trade networks Prince Bishop of Eichstätt obtained materials for the cultivation of domesticated sunflowers in his garden at Eichstätt, Bavaria, which were depicted in Besler's [Hortus Eystettensis](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10908) (1613). Eichstätt and Besler participated in a transregional network of Europeans who exchanged iconography and ideas related to the sunflower. This model visualizes some of the intersections among those authors, artists, translators, plant collectors, patrons, and other historical figures, focusing on the period from the 1550s to the 1650s. It also shows some instances in which illustrations of sunflowers—_Flos Solis maior_, _Flos Solis minor_, and _Chrysanthemum Peruvianum_—migrated from one book to another, possibly through sources not identified here. Such borrowings raise questions about the significance of individual plants and pictures, about relationships of images to text, about patterns of artistic exchange, and about the role of iconography in processes of knowledge production and transmission.

### Mythic Encounters and Scientific Debates

The migration of sunflower iconography is also evidenced in Francisco Hernández’s _[Nova plantarum](https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.136937)_ (1651).[^ref17] The book purports to document plants and animals that Hernández and his team, which included several indigenous artists, observed during a three-year expedition through Mexico in the 1570s. However, its illustrations of sunflowers, shown here, were not drawn on-site from local plants but rather borrowed from European models. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,130,569,546">The upper one</span> was adapted directly or through intermediary sources from the sunflower portrait made under Besler’s direction for inclusion in _Hortus Eystettensis_. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,554,570,546">The lower one</span> repurposes a design from a 1619 French-language translation of a text by Monardes, or a similar precedent. These appropriations have been interpreted as evidence that Hernández’s team of artists or later ones had to copy existing imagery because the sunflower was not yet established in Mexico at the time of his expedition. If that were so, Hernández’s inclusion of the sunflower in his manuscript recounted a mythic encounter with the plant, reproducing European misconceptions about its range that scientists would later dispute.

Although botanists have consulted herbals and other historical evidence to chart the movement of _Helianthus annuus_, they have also used maps of plant distribution and fossilized remains to study the origins of the plant.[^ref6] The earliest known sunflower remains—charred seeds—tell us that humans used _H._ _annuus_ at [Hayes shelter](http://opencontext.org/subjects/9cdf1026-42cd-4903-820c-e7415ede8900) in central Tennessee by 5000 BP and parts of eastern North America by 3000 BP.[^ref7] It is likely that, in the pre-5000 BP context, indigenous peoples transported wild sunflowers to their campsites, where the plants became stabilized and later cultivated to possess favorable traits, such as large  flower heads with more seeds.[^ref8]

The discussion of sunflowers in Hernández’s _Nova plantarum_ muddies debates among scientists about when humans used domesticated sunflowers in parts of the southwestern United States and Mexico, and whether they were cultivated independently there.[^ref9] A charred seed was recovered at San Andrés archaeological site in Tabasco, Mexico. Although some scientists identified the seed as coming from _H. annuus_, others argued that it may have come from a bottle gourd.[^ref10] Expanding on that archeological research, genomic studies of modern domesticated and wild sunflowers have linked the plants to a common ancestor, which was cultivated at an independent domestication center, along with pepo squash, marshelder, and chenopod, in <span data-click-map-flyto="37.347878, -89.590292">eastern North America</span>.[^ref11] For those reasons, several botanists have argued that _H. annuus_ was brought to Mexico via North American trade routes, possibly by Spanish colonizers.[^ref12]

By the early 1630s, when Anthony Van Dyck painted _Self-Portrait with Sunflower_, at right, there was a well-established iconography for representing the aesthetic qualities of sunflowers in Europe. Van Dyck, a Flemish artist working for Charles I of England, surely had numerous models to study such as herbals and emblems.[^ref18] In the portrait, the artist portrays himself wearing a gold chain gifted by the king in order to identify his position as a royal portraitist and member of the court. He also devotes nearly a third of the composition to describing the pert head and robust foliage of a blooming sunflower--a floral embodiment of his loyalty to his patron.

<param ve-entity eid="Q158082" title="heliotropum">
Europeans associated sunflowers with the human sentiments of loyalty and constancy because the plant's heliotropic phase recalled how, in an ancient Greek myth, the sea nymph Clytie expressed her devotion to the sun-god Helios.[^ref18] According to the story, Clytie competed unsuccessfully for Helios's affections. Scorned by him and shunned by her fellow nymphs, Clytie wasted away, wholly consumed with the act of gazing upon his chariot as it traversed the sky. Her suffering ended with her metamorphosis into a heliotrope, so-named for its movement toward the sun's rays. Yet, as this print shows, many seventeenth-century artists reinterpreted the narrative by recasting the flora mentioned therein as a sunflower.[^ref19] That break with conventions demonstrates the fashionability of the sunflower as a visual motif and the degree to which its imagery was entangled with beliefs about the flower's formal resemblance to the sun and, less often so, with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic.

<param ve-entity eid="Q1602587" title="heliotropism" aliases="heliotropic">
There is a longstanding cultural assumption that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and, once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena.[^ref20] Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement. These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages, too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation.

### Out of One, Many

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, botanical illustrators developed a refined iconography for representing sunflowers that allowed them to communicate  scientific knowledge. This hand-colored print _Anatomy of the Sunflower_, based on a design by the artist Peter Henderson, exemplifies a mode of artistic engagement with plants tailored to the needs of botanists. Henderson shows a partial view of two mature plants—facing opposite directions—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures. Yet Henderson takes some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality, making his design appealing to plant and art collectors alike. <span data-click-image-zoomto="982,2706,2213,1795">At the center of the left flower,</span> a series of green scallop-like shapes describe how bracts, or modified leaves, grow in concentric layers. Their slight curvature contrasts with a leaf that curls exuberantly away from the plant’s stem, leading the eye to <span data-click-image-zoomto="1448,813,4149,3588">the opposite flower.</span> Rust-orange “petals,” some with gold highlights, radiate outward from its dark-brown disk. <span data-click-image-zoomto="3200,1997,1038,897">A close look at the disk</span> reveals a circular band composed of stylized representations of yellow, five-petaled florets.

<param ve-entity eid="Q30765614" title="floret"> 
Henderson's botanical illustration highlights a trait of the sunflower that we may overlook due to our casual familiarity with the plant. Its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets. This diagram of a mature flower head shows that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets, which serve to attract pollinators to disk florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own seed after pollination. Perceiving such traits and intuiting their reproductive functions requires a process of direct observation, visual analysis, and patient contemplation akin to encountering an artwork.

During the latter half of the nineteenth century, a period of rapid industralization and urbanization in Europe, some painters developed new visual languages for representing sunflowers to explore the subjective experiences of encountering plants. In _Jerusalem Artichoke_, Claude Monet depicts an earthenware vase filled with cuttings of robust _Helianthus tuberosus_. He presents an impression of the plants's sprawling branches that approximates how the human eye perceives their brilliant gold heads and green foliage under a specific light condition. Conversely, Vincent van Gogh's _Sunflowers_ juxtaposes typical _Helianthus annuus_ blossoms with double-flower mutants. His portrayal of spent and still vigorous flowers, cut and arranged, explores the capacity of paint, floral forms, and actual plants to stir human emotions or spirituality. These artistic engagements with sunflowers model a kind of aesthetic and phenomenological attentiveness to plants to which we ought to aspire.

Contrary to what is most often portrayed in images and texts, the palette of _Helianthus_ is not limited to yellow. Indeed, there are more than fifty accepted species grouped under _Helianthus_ and, 
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Sunflower_%22Strawberry_Blonde%22_%283931552086%29.jpg/319px-Sunflower_%22Strawberry_Blonde%22_%283931552086%29.jpg){: .right}
their color can range from gold to orange to red to dark purple and even an unexpected shade of pink. Species also vary in terms of size and the number and shape of their leaves and flower heads, as demonstrated by these herbarium sheets with dried _Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower), _Helianthus giganteus_ (giant sunflower), and _Helianthus tuberosus_ (Jerusalem artichoke or sunchoke). The specimens also dispel the notion that sunflowers only have one large blossom per stock.

Sunflower seeds also exhibit variations in size, color, and markings. Whole seeds–comprised of a kernel and a hull–can be solid black or gray, and have a stripe pattern. The Hopi tribe of Native Americans have cultivated sunflowers with deep purple seeds, that appear black and shiny, in the southwest for hundreds of years. They use these seeds to produce dark blue or purple dyes for coloring wools and natural fibers that are in turn used to make [weavings and baskets.](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/american-indian-film-archive/hopi-arts-and-crafts?path=hopi-southwest-indians) The processes of cultivating, harvesting, and boiling seeds to produce dye for basketry are exaples of a rich tradition of tribal plant knowledge that is interwoven with cultural and spiritual beliefs. Indigenous peoples of North America also use(d) sunflowers in a variety of ways including as a source of food, fuel, pigment, dye, and medicine, as well as ceremonially.[^ref21]

### “Sun, sun, sun, here it comes”

As this map shows, the native range of _Helianthus_ stretches from British Columbia to southwest Mexico, though the plant has been introduced nearly worldwide. Because these visual representations shape and are shaped by our interactions with sunflowers, they can illuminate understudied aspects of human-plant relationships and shine a light on our responsibility to approach such encounters with more curiosity and care.
