Sunflowers hold a special status in the natural world. Highly valued for their edible seeds and seed oil, they are one of the few crop plants to have originated in North America. They are also popular ornamentals, renowned for their yellow flower heads with round disks and, in some cases, imposing height. Indeed, in cultivation Helianthus annuus (common sunflower) can grow up to sixteen feet tall, towering over us and other organisms. Yet, despite the relatively widespread cultivation of the sunflower and its iconic qualities, myths about the genus persist and these ideas have often shaped or been shaped by visual representations of the plant.

European, American, and Native American portrayals of the sunflower can provide valuable information about the histories of the plant and about the use of visual means to communicate knowledges, myths, and meanings relating to it. Artists, working from the European colonial period to the present day, often produced likenesses of the sunflower that fulfilled scientific, aesthetic, ceremonial, commercial, and other functions. Although such artists developed conventions for representing the plant that were tailored to realizing those aims, they consistently engaged with cultural beliefs about the flower’s formal resemblance to the sun and, less often so, with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic. These trends in [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) helped to perpetuate several myths about the sunflower that are still widely held today, while sometimes also propagating or illuminating stereotypes about societal markers of difference.

### _Helianthus_—The Iconic Flower and Its Iconography

The genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2)_—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—was named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, when the plant was still a rare curiosity in Europe. Although it may be hard for us to imagine that the sunflower was once regarded as a foreign luxury good, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant, in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_, offers some insights. He writes, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?” His observations about the splendor of the mature Helianthus inflorescence demonstrate some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans admired and that make the flower so iconic today.

Although Linnaeus gave _Helianthus_ and _H. annuus_ the botanical names by which they are officially known, it is arguable that the draftsperson, engraver, and colorist who produced the print, at right, helped to establish some enduring visual conventions for representing the sunflower in botanical circles and beyond. The engraved portrait of H. annuus, commissioned by Basilius Besler for the codex [Hortus Eystettensis](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10908), provides a striking and memorable vision of the plant at roughly life size. The image’s impact derives in part from a cruciform composition that imbues the mature flower head with a sense of power, a strong vertical line that bisects the stem and the disk to make its centermost circle a focal point, and a well-balanced arrangement of leaves with expressive shapes that move the eye around the blossom and anchor it in space. Through this emphasis on the sunflower’s aesthetic characteristics, as opposed to its medicinal properties, as in herbals, the picture provided an iconographic model for depicting ornamentals that would inspire artists for generations to come.

### Range and Cultivation

<param ve-image fit="contain" primary url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristanmhanson/plant-humanities/develop/images/sunflower_distribution_map.jpg" title="Distribution of _Helianthus_ native (green) and introduced (purple)">
The sunflowers represented in Besler’s _Hortus Eystettensis_ and described by Linnaeus were cultivated species, descended from North American progenitors. The native range of the genus Helianthus stretches from British Columbia to southwest Mexico, though, as this map indicates, it has been introduced across the world. The plant is primarily cultivated today as an oil crop because its seeds are rich in nutrients and relatively low in fatty acids. After oil is extracted from seeds, the byproducts are repurposed for use as animal feed or, in the case of hulls, ground to produce roughage or fuel. Sunflower crops also provide seeds for confectionary food and birdfeed. Because sunflowers are able to extract harmful containments from soil and water, a process known as phytoremediation, they have been planted at the sites of the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi disasters to absorb radiation. In addition to those uses, sunflowers are cultivated as ornamentals for domestic settings, and Native Americans use(d) the plant as a source of food, fuel, pigments, dye, medicine, and for ceremonial functions.

Paleoethnobotanists, who study plant remains collected at sites, have determined that Native Americans were using cultivated sunflowers in parts of North America by YEAR. Charles B. Heiser, Jr. and Bruce D. Smith, both prominent botanists, have analyzed charred seeds found at a number of different sites in order to consider when and where humans cultivated sunflowers.

### Out of One, Many

Our familiarity with the sunflower, both real and represented, may lead us to overlook the fact that its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets. This diagram of a mature flower head shows that its disk consists of florets and that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own seed after pollination. Although these traits may come as a surprise to us, botanical illustrators developed an iconography to communicate information about them in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

This hand-colored print _Anatomy of the Sunflower_, based on a design by the artist Peter Henderson, exemplifies a sophisticated understanding of the plant. Henderson shows a partial view of two mature plants—one facing back, and the other nearly front—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures, while taking some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality. At the center of the left flower, a series of green scallop- and flame-like shapes describe how bracts, or modified leaves, grow in concentric layers. Their slight curvature contrasts with a leaf that curls exuberantly away from the plant’s stem, leading the eye to the opposite flower. Rust-orange “petals,” some with gold highlights, radiate outward from its dark-brown disk. A close look at the disk reveals a circular band composed of stylized representations of yellow, five-petaled florets. These details remind us that the study of art and flora are endeavors rooted in the practices of direct observation and visual analysis.

Henderson’s design for _Anatomy of the Sunflower_ also articulates Linnaeus’s contributions to botany as they relate to _Helianthus_. Linnaeus developed a plant taxonomy that he based on the number, arrangement, and similarities of reproductive organs: stamen(s) and pistil(s). The tremendous influence of this system on the production of knowledge about and portrayal of plants is evident in the lower right corner of Anatomy of the Sunflower, where there are precise depictions of such organs. This series of details was essential to the function of the picture; it was commissioned by Dr. Robert John Thornton for his book New illustration of the sexual system of Carolus von Linnaeus. Thornton’s “new” book was distinct from an earlier publication on Linnaeus by John Miller, whose print _Helianthus annuus_ served as the inspiration for or shared the same model as Henderson’s.

We may also be surprised to discover the diversity within the genus _Helianthus_. Indeed, there are more than fifty accepted species grouped under Helianthus and, contrary to what is often portrayed in images and texts, their palette is not limited to yellow. Their color can range from gold to orange to red and even an unexpected shade of pink. Species also vary in terms of size and the number and shape of their leaves and flower heads, as demonstrated by these herbarium sheets with dried _Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower), _Helianthus giganteus_ (giant sunflower), and _Helianthus tuberosus_ (Jerusalem artichoke or sunchoke). The specimens also dispel the notion that sunflowers only have one large blossom per stock.

Still life paintings provide another rich source of evidence regarding plant diversity, conveying information that cannot be preserved on herbarium sheets. Claude Monet’s _Jerusalem artichoke_ presents an impression of _Helianthus tuberosus_ in which he studies how the eye perceives its color and form, whereas Vincent van Gogh’s _Sunflowers_ engages with the tactile and emotive aspects of _Helianthus annuus_ by juxtaposing typical blossoms and double-flower mutants. The pictures not only show us different species, but also model for us a kind of aesthetic and phenomenological attentiveness to the plant world to which we ought to aspire.

### Sun-Shaped though Not Necessarily Golden

Having dispelled several cultural myths about the sunflower, we now turn to another. It is widely believed that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and, once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena, publishing their exciting findings in 2016.Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement. These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages, too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation. Widespread coverage of those findings by the media no doubt generated new excitement about the plant in recent years.
