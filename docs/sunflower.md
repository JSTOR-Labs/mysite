_Helianthus annuus_ (common or annual sunflower) holds a special status in the plant kingdom. The species is among a small number of crop plants that humans first domesticated in North America thousands of years ago and the only one that is still widely used today.[^ref1] Indeed, the domesticated sunflower is primarily grown as an oil seed crop, having been introduced from its native range in North America nearly worldwide. The cultivated sunflower is also a popular ornamental, renowned for its yellow flower head, large disk, heart-shaped or ovate leaves, unbranched stem, and imposing height. Remarkably, the plant can grow freestanding up to sixteen feet tall and [nearly twice that](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-sunflower) when supported.

Yet, as this botanical illustration reminds us, domesticated _Helianthus annuus_ also has an imposing presence in the visual arts. Like the supersized flower in this plant portrait, the sunflower looms large in many cultural imaginaries. So large, in fact, that we may be more familiar with sunflower imagery than with actual sunflowers. The proliferation of the flower in European art since the later sixteenth century is due partly to the aesthetic appeal of traits artificially selected to increase seed production, a single flower head with a large disk, and partly to the timing of its introduction to Europe just prior to the blossoming of a new genre of botanical treatise, called the [florilegium](https://wordsmith.org/words/florilegium.html) ("collection of flowers"), in the 1610s.

<param ve-entity eid="Q861716" title="visual culture">
Sunflower imagery can provide rich historical information about the plant and the roles of visual culture in communicating knowledges, myths, and meanings related to it. Artists working in Europe from the age of colonization to the modern period produced many likenesses of the sunflower, which served aesthetic, imperial, scientific, commercial, and other functions. In doing so, they developed conventions for representing specific characteristics of sunflowers that were tailored to those aims. By tracking changes in that [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) over time, we can learn about the historical significance of sunflowers in specific temporal and geographic contexts, as well as shifts in the ways that humans have represented, encountered, used, studied, and valued them. Through that practice of close visual analysis, that engaging with artworks necessarily involves, we also cultivate a greater attentiveness to bring to our encounters with plants.

### Naming the Iconic Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q10432667306" title="Carl Linnaeus" aliases="Carolus Linnaeus">
<param ve-entity eid="Q66425303" title="iconic">
The genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2%29)_—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—and the species _Helianthus annuus_ were named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, by which time the domesticated sunflower was already a beloved garden flower in Europe.[^ref2] Although it may be hard for us to imagine the extraordinary admiration for the sunflower at that time, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_ (1737), offers some insights. He asks, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?”[^ref3] His encomium on the splendor of a mature _Helianthus_ inflorescence celebrates its formal resemblance to the sun demonstrates some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans prized and that make the flower, both real and represented, so iconic today.

Herbals provide rich, albeit incomplete, historical evidence about the sunflower in the sixteenth century.[^ref4] Although these treatises suggest that it was the Spanish who first introduced cultivated _Helianthus annuus_ to Europe, they generally omit any information about the plant’s harvesting and the impact of that exploitative practice, now termed “[extraction colonialism](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2015/a-typology-of-colonialism),” on Indigenous peoples and local habitats. Yet, despite those omissions, herbals offer insights about the significance of domesticated _H. annuus_ because they contain the first known verbal and visual descriptions of the plant authored by Europeans. They primarily highlight the sunflower’s showy blossom and imposing height, revealing that, unlike most flora then imported for medicinal or culinary uses, it held a special status as an ornamental and a foreign curiosity.

Once introduced to Spain, the domesticated sunflower quickly migrated to parts of Italy and the Low Countries via transregional trade routes, as did images of it.[^ref5] Networks of wealthy and privileged Europeans, most of who were men, exchanged plant materials for cultivating _Helianthus annuus_ and instructions for doing so in letters and drawings. Pietro Andrea Mattioli acknowledged his receipt of such correspondence in a late edition of his herbal _[I Discori](https://ia601904.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/3/items/gri_33125014246561/gri_33125014246561_jp2.zip&file=gri_33125014246561_jp2/gri_33125014246561_0029.jp2&id=gri_33125014246561&scale=6.211180124223603&rotate=0)_, from 1568, as did Rembert Dodoens in _[Florum, et coronariarum](https://archive.org/details/Florum-et-coronariarum-odoratarumque-nonnullarum-herbarum-historia-Remberto-Dodo-PHAIDRA_o_358242/page/n309/mode/2up)_ of the same year. This model visualizes some of their connections with a group of proto botanists, patrons, publishers, artists, and members of royal courts who, through epistolary and direct interactions, exchanged information about sunflowers that was then recounted in herbals produced in the 1560s and 1570s.

The advent of the florilegium in the 1610s was integral to the blossoming of sunflower aesthetics as is evidenced in the sumptuous contents of [_Hortus Eystettensis_](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10908).[^ref6] The 1613 book was commissioned from Basilius Besler by the Prince Bishop of Eichstätt, who wished to document rare and foreign flora then growing in his garden. As part of the project, Besler oversaw the production of this hand-colored [engraving](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary) of a domesticated sunflower shown life-sized. The image’s impact derives not only from its impressive dimensions but also from its bold cruciform composition, both of which imbue the full flower head and stem with a sense of power evocative of religious reverence for nature. A symmetrical design makes the flower’s disk spiral a focal point around which irregular ray florets lend rhythm and heart-shaped leaves decorative flourish. These formal strategies were innovative for the time because they celebrated the sunflower’s beauty above its use value, unlike most illustrations then found in herbals. For that reason, Besler’s _Flos Solis maior_ became an influential model for visualizing _H. annuus_ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristanmhanson/plant-humanities/develop/images/Sunflower%20emoji_openmoji.org_tiny.jpg){: .right}
that anticipated modern visual stereotypes for the plant, perhaps best epitomized by this tiny sunflower emoji.

### Mythic Encounters and Scientific Debates

The migration of sunflower iconography from Besler’s _Hortus Eystettensis_  to other sources is evidenced in the pages of Francisco Hernández’s _[Nova plantarum](https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.136937)_, published posthumously in 1651. The book purports to document plants and animals that Hernández and his team, which included several Indigenous artists, observed during a three-year expedition through New Spain (present-day Mexico) in the 1570s.[^ref7] However, its illustrations of sunflowers, shown here, were not drawn on-site from local flora but rather borrowed from European models. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,130,569,546">The upper one</span> was adapted directly or through intermediary sources from the sunflower portrait _Flos Solis maior_ made under Besler’s direction. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,554,570,546">The lower one</span> repurposes a design from a florilegium that was itself republished in a 1619 French-language translation of a [text by Nicolás Monardes](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/7815694). These appropriations have been interpreted as evidence that Hernández’s team of artists or those working on his manuscript at a later date had to copy existing imagery because the sunflower was not established in New Spain at the time of his expedition.[^ref8] If that is so, as modern-day botanists argue, Hernández’s discussion of the sunflower implied a mythic encounter with the plant that reproduced European misconceptions about its range.

Although European herbals perpetuated a cultural myth that the domesticated sunflower originated in Peru and was present in Mexico prior to colonization, botanists debunked these ideas by using distribution maps and fossilized remains to study the plant’s origin and range.[^ref9] The earliest known cultivated sunflower remains—charred seeds, more accurately termed “achenes”—tell us that humans used _Helianthus annuus_ at [Hayes shelter](http://opencontext.org/subjects/9cdf1026-42cd-4903-820c-e7415ede8900) in central Tennessee by 5000 BP and parts of eastern North America by 3000 BP.[^ref10] It is likely that, in the pre-5000 BP context, Indigenous peoples transported wild sunflowers to their campsites, where the plants became stabilized and later cultivated to possess desirable traits, namely large flower heads with more seeds.[^ref11]

Yet scientists still disagree about when humans used domesticated sunflowers in parts of the southwestern United States and Mexico, and whether such plants were cultivated independently there.[^ref12] An ongoing source of debate is the origin of a charred seed that was recovered at San Andrés archaeological site in Tabasco, Mexico. Although some scientists identified the seed as coming from cultivated _Helianthus annuus_, others argued that it probably came from a bottle gourd.[^ref13] Expanding on that archeological research, genomic studies of modern domesticated and wild sunflowers have linked the plants to a single common ancestor, which was cultivated at an independent domestication center, along with pepo squash, marsh elder, and chenopod, in <span data-click-map-flyto="37.347878, -89.590292">eastern North America</span>.[^ref14] For these reasons, botanists have argued that domesticated _H. annuus_ was brought to Mexico via North American trade routes, probably by Spanish colonizers.[^ref15]

By the early 1630s, when Anthony Van Dyck painted _Self-Portrait with Sunflower_, at right, there was a well-established iconography in Europe for representing the aesthetic qualities of sunflowers. Van Dyck, a Flemish artist under the patronage of Charles I of England, surely had numerous printed models from which to work.[^ref16] Such imagery was known to artists through emblems and florilegia, particularly those produced by Crispijn van de Passe and Adriaen Collaert. Regardless of which sources were consulted, Van Dyck’s painting presents a lively image of the artist who appears to have just turned his head to face us, as though we spontaneously discovered him admiring a sunflower unawares in a pleasure garden. The painter fingers an opulent gold chain, gifted by the King, that identifies his position as a royal portraitist and member of the court. His index finger directs our gaze to the pert head and robust foliage of a golden sunflower—a glorious floral manifestation of his loyalty to his patron.

Europeans associated sunflowers with the human sentiments of loyalty and constancy because the plant's heliotropic phase recalled how, in an ancient Greek myth, the sea nymph Clytie expressed her devotion to the sun-god Helios.[^ref17] According to the story, Clytie competed unsuccessfully for Helios's affections. Scorned by him and shunned by her fellow nymphs, Clytie wasted away, wholly consumed with gazing upon his chariot as it traversed the sky. Her suffering ended with her metamorphosis into a heliotrope, so named for its flowers' movement toward the sun's rays. Heliotropism was associated with _Heliotropium_ in ancient Rome and later with _Calendula_ or the marigold in [medieval Europe](https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/in-season/2014/climbing-in-the-garden). Yet, as this print shows, European artists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries portrayed Clytie’s attribute as a sunflower.[^ref18] That floral inventiveness demonstrates the fashionability of the sunflower as a motif, and the degree to which it was entangled not only with beliefs about the flower's formal resemblance to the sun but also with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic.

There is a longstanding cultural assumption that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena.[^ref19] Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement. These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, botanical illustrators developed a refined iconography for representing cultivated sunflowers that allowed them to communicate scientific knowledge about the plant. This hand-colored print _Anatomy of the Sunflower_, designed by [Peter Henderson](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500042021), exemplifies a mode of artistic engagement with plants tailored to the needs of botanists. Henderson’s image shows a partial view of two mature plants—facing opposite directions—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures. Yet Henderson takes some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality, expanding the appeal of the illustration beyond scientists to plant and art collectors as well. <span data-click-image-zoomto="982,2706,2213,1795">At the center of the left flower,</span> a series of green scallop-like shapes describe how bracts grow in concentric layers.

Henderson's botanical illustration highlights a trait of sunflowers that we may overlook due to our casual familiarity with the plant. Its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets.[^ref20] This diagram of a mature flower head shows that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets, which are sterile and serve to attract pollinators to disk florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own fruit after pollination. Perceiving such floral traits and examining their functions requires a process of direct observation and visual analysis akin to making and studying artistic representations of plants.

Henderson’s design for _Anatomy of the Sunflower_ models that sort of attentiveness to the plant world while also articulating Linnaeus’s contributions to botany as they relate to _Helianthus_. Linnaeus developed a plant taxonomy that he based on the number, arrangement, and similarities of reproductive organs: stamen(s) and pistil(s).

In the later-nineteenth century, many European painters embraced the genre of still life to explore the expressive capacities of paint, plants, and floral forms. Indeed, Vincent van Gogh cultivated a signature style of representing domesticated sunflowers in which he emphasized color, shape, and texture. In this 1888 painting, entitled _Sunflowers_, he uses a striking range of intense yellows to depict an arrangement of more than a dozen blooms. The disparate hues and shapes of their radiant ocher, mustard, and golden-orange flower heads indicate that two different types of cultivated _Helianthus annuus_ are portrayed here and that they were harvested at different stages of their life cycles. The sunflowers, <span data-click-image-zoomto="9,1135,1311,1118">at top left</span> and center, have shed ray florets and started to wilt, whereas many of their plush counterparts—a double-flowered variety known as the <span data-click-image-zoomto="2050,113,1311,1118">"Teddy Bear"</span>—are still vibrant.[^ref21] Van Gogh painted <span data-click-image-zoomto="-1158,0,7037,6001">these sunflowers</span> directly from life during the summer of 1888, after moving from Paris to Arles, France, the previous winter.[^ref22] We can therefore read his golden palette and radiant sunflowers as metaphorically evoking the bright warm light of southern France that nurtured his painting practice and the growth of the sorts of flowers that are shown here.

Contrary to what is most often portrayed in visual and verbal descriptions of sunflowers, the palette of _Helianthus annuus_ is not limited to yellow. Rather, there are many _H. annuus_ cultivars

with flowers that can range from gold to orange to red to dark purple and even an unexpected shade of pink. There are also more than fifty accepted species grouped under _Helianthus_ and they vary in terms of size and the number and shape of their leaves and flower heads. The specimens of _Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower), _Helianthus giganteus_ (giant sunflower), and _Helianthus tuberosus_ (Jerusalem artichoke or sunchoke) on these herbarium sheets also dispel the false notion that all sunflowers only have one large blossom per stock. That trait, as we now know, is unique to the domesticated sunflower and due to human selection.

Sunflower seeds also exhibit variations in size, color, and markings. Whole seeds–comprised of a kernel and a husk–can be solid black or gray and have a stripe pattern. The Hopi tribe of Native Americans have cultivated [sunflowers with deep purple seeds](https://www.nativeseeds.org/pages/hopi-black-dye-sunflower), that appear black and shiny, in the southwest for hundreds of years.[^ref23] They use these seeds to produce dark blue or purple dyes for coloring wools and vegetal fibers that are in turn used to make [weavings or baskets](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/american-indian-film-archive/hopi-arts-and-crafts?path=hopi-southwest-indians). The processes of cultivating, harvesting, and boiling seeds to produce dye for basketry are examples of a rich tradition of tribal plant knowledge that is interwoven with cultural and spiritual beliefs. Indigenous peoples of North America also [use(d) sunflowers in a variety of ways](http://naeb.brit.org/uses/search/?string=sunflower) including as a source of food, fuel, pigment, and medicine, as well as ceremonially.

Visual representations of sunflowers have shaped and been shaped by human interactions with them. By analyzing such imagery, we can become more attuned to the significance of human encounters with sunflowers and our own engagements with plants. That kind of attentive regard for plant life is essential if we are to enter into sustainable relationships with it. These and other ideas attain visibility in Vincent van Gogh's [memento mori](%5D(https:/www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/m/memento-mori), at right, from 1887. In _Sunflowers_, the artist shows a dried disk with exposed kernels and a desiccated yellow husk resting on a somber blue ground. His defamiliarization of the cut flower heads unsettles our tendencies to appreciate sunflowers for their beauty or utility and construe plants as infinitely replenishable natural resources. On those grounds, we can interpret Van Gogh’s picture as an invitation to bring greater attentiveness, care, and gratitude to our relationships with plants.
