_Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower) holds a special status in the plant kingdom. Highly valued for its edible seeds and seed oil, the species is among a small number of crop plants to have been domesticated in North America. The cultivated annual is also a popular ornamental, renowned for its yellow flower head with a round disk and its imposing height. Indeed, _H. annuus_ can grow freestanding up to sixteen feet tall—a trait exaggerated for comedic effect in this idiosyncratic botanical illustration. Its sunflower towers over a canine of formidable size: the greyhound. Like that giant flower, _H. annuus_ looms large in the plant world and our cultural imagination, so large that we often fail to recognize the diversity within the genus sunflower.

Today, because of _H. annuus_’s iconic formal qualities and widespread cultivation, we tend to essentialize all sunflowers by assuming that they have a single, golden blossom perched on an unbranched stem. Such cultural myths have often shaped or been shaped by visual representations of the plant, particularly those depicting _H. annuus_.

This visual narrative clarifies how certain pictures of the sunflower provide valuable historical information about the genus and the roles of visual culture in communicating knowledges, myths, and meanings related to the plant world. Artists working in Europe and America from the colonial period to the present day, produced likenesses of the sunflower that served aesthetic, scientific, commercial, and other functions. Although such artists developed conventions for representing sunflowers tailored to those aims, they consistently engaged with cultural beliefs about the flower’s formal resemblance to the sun and, less often so, with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic. These trends in [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) have over time contributed to a visual stereotype of the sunflower that elides species differences and perpetuates myths.

### Naming and Representing the Iconic Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q10432667306" title="Carl Linnaeus" aliases="Carolus Linnaeus">
The genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2)_—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—was named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, by which time the plant was already a beloved garden flower in Europe. Although it may be hard for us to imagine the extraordinary admiration of the sunflower at that time, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant, in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_, offers some insights. He writes, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?” His encomium on the splendor of the mature _Helianthus_ inflorescence demonstrates some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans prized and that make the flower so iconic today.

Although Linnaeus gave _Helianthus_ and _H. annuus_ their official botanical names, it is arguable that Basilius Besler, who oversaw the production of the print, at right, helped to establish some visual conventions for representing the sunflower. A team of artists, etchers, printmakers, and colorists, hired by Besler, produced the hand-tinted [engraving](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary) of _H. annuus_, a striking depiction of the plant shown life-sized. The image’s impact derives not only from its impressive dimensions, but also from its bold cruciform composition, which imbues the full flower head and stock with a sense of power. A symmetrical design makes the flower’s disk spiral a focal point around which irregular ray florets lend rhythm and heart-shaped leaves decorative flourish. These formal strategies were innovative for the time because they emphasized the sunflower’s beauty. For that reason, Besler’s _Flos Solis maior_ became an influential model for visualizing the sunflower that is also evocative of modern and contemporary visual stereotypes for the plant.

### Range and Cultivation

The history of _Helianthus annuus_ is enmeshed with mobility. We can chart that movement by using maps to study the locations associated with visual representations, fossilized plant remains, and other forms of evidence. The earliest known sunflower remains—charred seeds—tell us that humans used _Helianthus_ _annuus_ in central Tennessee by 5000 BP and parts of eastern North America by 3000 BP. It is likely that, in the pre-5000 BP context, indigenous peoples transported wild sunflowers to their campsites, where the plants became stabilized and later by humans. That movement of seeds and plant materials was essential to the evolution of _H. annuus_ through a process of human selection.
<param ve-map center="0.040297, -71.224280" zoom="3.8" marker-type="circle" stroke-width="0" fill-opacity="1">

There is some debate about when domesticated sunflowers were used in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, and whether they were cultivated independently there. Although a charred seed was recovered at NAME SITE that some scientists identified as coming from _H. annuus_, others argued convincingly that the seed, which is no longer extant, may have come from a squash or a wild sunflower. In the absence of more definitive archeological proof, scientists have also consulted linguistic evidence to learn about sunflower domestication. The Aztecs had several Nahuatl words (“X” and “Y”) for the cultivated sunflower that bear no relation to the Spanish “X,” implying that _H. annuus_ may have been established in the Aztec Empire prior to the colonial period. But these ideas have also been challenged. More recently, genomic studies of the common sunflower have linked present-day crops and seed remains to a common ancestor, which was cultivated at an independent domestication center in eastern North America. For all of those reasons, some scientists believe that _H. annuus_ was brought to Mexico via trade networks, possibly even by the Spanish.

Although the Spanish were probably the first to transport the domesticated sunflower overseas to Europe, questions persist about who first collected such plants or seeds, and when and from where they did so. In the absence of surviving specimens, visual and verbal representation of the sunflower help us to chart its movement to Spain and parts of Europe. Nicolas Monardes’s herbal _[Dos libros](https://archive.org/details/hin-wel-all-00002448-001)_ (1565) contains the first known description of a sunflower written by a European. Monardes, who did not travel to the Americas, authored the text based on plants grown in his botanical garden in Seville. The arrival of the sunflower to Flanders via transregional trade networks is evidenced by Rembert Dodoens’s herbal _[Florum, et Coronariarum](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48323400)_ (1568): the first book to reproduce an illustration of a sunflower.

### "Peruvian" Origins and Mythic Encounters

<param ve-entity eid="Q2094286" title="Petrus van der Borcht">
<param ve-entity eid="Q6165948" title="herbal" aliases=" herbals"> 
Visual and verbal representations of the sunflower chart not only the transoceanic movement of plants, but also the transregional exchange of iconography and ideas pertaining to them. That is true of the sunflower pictured in Dodoens’s _Florum, et Coronariarum_, shown at right. The [woodcut](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary), designed by Petrus van der Borcht, depicts a mature _Helianthus annuus_ planted in soil as the artist may have encountered it displayed in a garden. Indeed, Dodoens’s description identifies a private garden, in Mechlin, as the place shown in the picture:  "They call this plant the ‘Sun of India’ (or ‘Indian Sun’) because it so resembles a sun surrounded by rays. We saw this plant in the delightful garden abundant with any variety of plants belonging to the excellent and worthy Johannes Brancio . . . . You may seek it in vain elsewhere, only to find it in his garden." Dodoens’s account, if accurate, charts sunflower migration to Flanders by the mid-1560s. However, the provenance of such plants remains muddy. Whereas Dodoens gives the sunflower the name _Chrysanthemum Peruvianum_ to indicate its Peruvian origins, the word “Peru” was often used indiscriminately during the period to mean someplace in the Americas. That misinformation was repeated in subsequent books, propagating a myth about the sunflower’s “Peruvian” origins.

This network visualization offers a preliminary model for studying the transregional exchange of iconography and ideas related to the sunflower. It shows the interconnectedness of botanists, scholars, artists, translators, plant connoisseurs, patrons, and other figures who were active in the botanical realm in Europe and the Americas between the mid-1500s and the mid-1660s. This web of interactions also illuminates some instances in which sunflower iconography migrated from one herbal to another, raising questions about the meanings of such pictures, about the relationship of images, text, and plants, and about larger patterns of exchange.

The migration of sunflower iconography is evidenced in Francisco Hernández’s _[Nova plantarum](https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.136937)_ (1651). The book describes plants and other natural resources that Hernández encountered during a 1570s expedition to Mexico. It contains two illustrations of sunflowers, which were borrowed from European sources. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,130,569,546">The upper one</span> was likely adapted from the sunflower portrait made under Besler’s direction for inclusion _[Hortus Eystettensis](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10908)_ (1613), a catalog of the exotic flowers grown in Prince Bishop of Eichstätt’s garden in Bavaria. <span data-click-image-zoomto="237,554,570,546">The lower one</span> resembles an illustration published in a 1619 French-language translation of an herbal by Monardes. These borrowing prompted the botanist Charles B. Heiser to ask the following: Why would the artists who created those illustrations for Hernández’s report copy old sources instead of working from drawings of local plants? According to Heiser, they did so for _Helianthus annuus_ because the species was not established in Mexico at the time of Hernández visit, though the explorer would have known it through connections in Europe.

Europeans eagerly collected exotic flora from the Americas because such plants were highly valued for their medicinal and culinary properties, in addition to being foreign curiosities and status symbols. That practice of “collecting” natural resources, known as [extractive colonialism](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2015/a-typology-of-colonialism), often involved violent confrontations with indigenous inhabitants. The title page of John Park's _Theatricum Botanicum_ features a sunflower.

### “I’ll Follow the Sun”: Heliotropism as Myth and Metaphor

Heliotropism in plants was observed by the ancient Greeks and this phenomenon is a central conceit in the myth of Clytie and Helios. Explain the myth. The associations of the sunflower in this narrative with notions of WHAT proved influential in Western European art and culture. Introduce idea of constancy and then connect to heliotropism.

<param ve-entity eid="Q1602587" title="heliotropism" aliases="heliotropic">
Having dispelled several cultural myths about the sunflower, we now turn to another. It is widely believed that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and, once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena, publishing their exciting findings in 2016.Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement. These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages, too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation. Widespread coverage of those findings by the media no doubt generated new excitement about the plant in recent years.

### Out of One, Many

<param ve-entity eid="Q30765614" title="floret"> 
Our familiarity with the sunflower, both real and represented, may lead us to overlook the fact that its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets. This diagram of a mature flower head shows that its disk consists of florets and that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own seed after pollination. Although these traits may come as a surprise to us, botanical illustrators developed an iconography to communicate information about them in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

This hand-colored print _Anatomy of the Sunflower_, based on a design by the artist Peter Henderson, exemplifies a sophisticated understanding of the plant. Henderson shows a partial view of two mature plants—one facing back, and the other nearly front—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures, while taking some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality. <span data-click-image-zoomto="982,2706,2213,1795">At the center of the left flower,</span> a series of green scallop- and flame-like shapes describe how bracts, or modified leaves, grow in concentric layers.

Henderson’s design for _Anatomy of the Sunflower_ also articulates Linnaeus’s contributions to botany as they relate to _Helianthus_. Linnaeus developed a plant taxonomy that he based on the number, arrangement, and similarities of reproductive organs: stamen(s) and pistil(s). The tremendous influence of this system on the production of knowledge about and portrayal of plants is evident in the <span data-click-image-zoomto="2862,4454,2123,1782">lower right corner of _Anatomy of the Sunflower_,</span> where there are precise depictions of such organs. This series of details was essential to the function of the picture; it was commissioned by Dr. Robert John Thornton for his book _[New illustration of the sexual system of Carolus von Linnaeus](http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990075420710203941/catalog)_.

Still life paintings provide another rich source of evidence regarding plant diversity, conveying information that cannot be preserved on herbarium sheets. Claude Monet's _Jerusalem artichoke_ presents an impression of _Helianthus tuberosus_ in which he studies how the eye perceives its color and form, whereas Vincent van Gogh's _Sunflowers_ engages with the tactile and emotive aspects of _Helianthus annuus_ by juxtaposing typical blossoms and double-flower mutants. The pictures not only show us different species, but also model for us a kind of aesthetic and phenomenological attentiveness to the plant world to which we ought to aspire.

As this map shows, the native range of _Helianthus_ stretches from British Columbia to southwest Mexico, though the plant has been introduced nearly worldwide. Sunflowers are a popular oil crop because their seeds are rich in nutrients and relatively low in fatty acids. After oil is extracted from seeds, the byproducts are repurposed for use as animal feed or, in the case of hulls, ground to produce roughage or fuel. Sunflower crops also provide seeds for confectionary food and birdfeed. In the X century, the sunflower became a favored oil crop in Russia because it was one of the few sources of protein that the Orthodox Church did not ban during Lent. Farmers in Russia bred a giant sunflower—NAME—that to increase seed yields. That species was introduced to North America in the mid twentieth century and it is the one most widely cultivated there today. In addition to those uses, sunflowers are cultivated as ornamentals for domestic settings, and EN Because sunflowers are able to extract harmful containments from soil and water, a process known as phytoremediation, they have been planted at the sites of the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi disasters to absorb radiation.
