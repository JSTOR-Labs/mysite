_Helianthus annuus_ (common sunflower) holds a special status in the plant kingdom. Highly valued for its edible seeds and seed oil, the species is among a small number of crop plants to have been domesticated in North America. The cultivated annual is also a popular ornamental, renowned for its yellow flower head with a round disk and its imposing height. Indeed, _H. annuus_ can grow freestanding up to sixteen feet tall—a trait exaggerated for comedic effect in this idiosyncratic botanical illustration of a sunflower towering over a greyhound. Like that giant flower, _H. annuus_ looms large in the plant world and the cultural imaginary, so large that it is sometimes hard for us to recognize the diversity within the genus sunflower.

Today, because of _H. annuus_’s iconic formal qualities and widespread cultivation, we are likely to essentialize all sunflowers by assuming that every member of the genus has a single, golden blossom perched on an unbranched stem. Such cultural myths have often shaped or been shaped by visual representations of the plant, particularly those depicting _H. annuus_.

Pictures of the sunflower can provide valuable historical information about the genus and the roles of visual culture in communicating knowledges, myths, and meanings related to the plant world. Artists working in Europe and America from the colonial period to the present day, produced likenesses of the sunflower that served aesthetic, scientific, commercial, and other functions. Although such artists developed conventions for representing sunflowers that were tailored to those aims, they consistently engaged with cultural beliefs about the flower’s formal resemblance to the sun and, less often so, with misconceptions about the mature plant being heliotropic. These trends in [iconography](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/iconography) have often elided differences between species and perpetuated myths about sunflowers, while they have sometimes also served to uphold, challenge, or illuminate stereotypes pertaining to societal markers of difference.

### Naming and Representing the Iconic Flower

<param ve-entity eid="Q10432667306" title="Carl Linnaeus">
The genus _[Helianthus](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000729-2)_—a Latin compound derived from the Greek words _helios_ (sun) and _anthos_ (flower)—was named by the prominent Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, by which time the plant was already a beloved garden flower in Europe. Although it may be hard for us to imagine the extraordinary admiration of the sunflower at that time, Linnaeus’s exuberant description of the plant, in _[Critica botanica](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11541)_, offers some insights. He writes, “Who can see this plant in flower, whose great golden blossoms send out rays in every direction from the circular disk, without admiring the handsome flower modeled on the sun’s shape?” His encomium on the splendor of the mature _Helianthus_ inflorescence demonstrates some traits that eighteenth-century Europeans prized and that make the flower so iconic today.

Although Linnaeus gave _Helianthus_ and _H. annuus_ their official botanical names, it is arguable that Basilius Besler, who oversaw the production of the print, at right, helped to establish some visual conventions for representing the sunflower. A team of artists, etchers, printmakers, and colorists, hired by Besler, produced the hand-tinted [engraving](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/margaret-mee-portraits-of-plants/essays-interviews-resources/glossary) of _H. annuus_, a striking depiction of the plant shown life-sized. The image’s impact derives not only from its impressive dimensions, but also from its bold cruciform composition, which imbues the full flower head and stock with a sense of power. A symmetrical design makes the flower’s disk spiral a focal point around which irregular ray florets lend rhythm and heart-shaped leaves decorative flourish. These formal strategies were innovative for the time because they emphasized the sunflower’s beauty. For that reason, Besler’s _Flos Solis maior_ became an influential model for visualizing the sunflower that is also evocative of modern and contemporary visual stereotypes for the plant.

### Range and Cultivation

The history of _Helianthus annuus_ is enmeshed with mobility. We can chart that movement by using maps to study the locations associated with visual representations, fossilized plant remains, and other forms of evidence. The earliest known sunflower remains—charred seeds—tell us that humans used _Helianthus_ _annuus_ in central Tennessee by 5000 BP and parts of eastern North America by 3000 BP. It is likely that, in the pre-5000 BP context, indigenous peoples transported wild sunflowers to their campsites, where the plants became stabilized and later by humans. That movement of seeds and plant materials was essential to the evolution of _H. annuus_ through a process of human selection.
<param ve-map center="0.040297, -71.224280" zoom="3.8" marker-type="circle" stroke-width="0" fill-opacity="1">

There is some debate about when domesticated sunflowers were used in southwestern North America and Mexico. Although charred seed remains thought to be from _H. annuus_ have been recovered from those areas, it is possible that the seeds actually came from squash or wild sunflowers. Linguistic evidence, however, suggests that _H. annuus_ was established in the Aztec Empire prior to the arrival of the Spanish. Indeed, the Aztecs had several Nahuatl words (“X” and “Y”) for the cultivated sunflower that bear no relation to the Spanish “X.” Still, the presence of _H. annuus_ in the Aztec Empire does not tell us whether it was cultivated independently in Mexico or brought there via trade networks. To answer that question, scientists conducted genomic studies of _H. annuus_ crops from Mexico, and they found that all modern _H. annuus_ share a common ancestor that can be traced to a domestication center in eastern North America.

Although we know that the Spanish were the first people to transport the domesticated sunflower across the Atlantic Ocean, questions persist about when and from where in the Americas they collected such plants or seeds. One hypothesis is that Hernando de Soto, who traveled to the southeastern United States, between 1539 and 1543, was the first person to introduce the plant to Europe. In the absence of surviving specimens, we can use visual and verbal accounts of the sunflower to map its introduction to Spain and other parts of Europe. Nicolas Monardes’s _[Dos libros](https://archive.org/details/hin-wel-all-00002448-001)_ (1565) contains the first known description of the sunflower by a European. Monardes wrote that description based on his observations of plants grown in his botanical garden in Seville. The spread of the sunflower to Flanders via transregional botanical networks is evidenced in the pages of Rembert Dodoens’s _[Florum, et Coronariarum](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48323400)_ (1568): the first book to feature an illustration of the plant.

The visual representation robust stock, heart-shaped leaves, a single flower head per stock. “They call this plant the 'Sun of India' (or 'Indian Sun') because it so resembles a sun surrounded by rays. We saw this plant in the delightful garden abundant with any variety of plants belonging to the excellent and worthy Johannes Brancio, a man who is very knowledgeable about the diversity of plants and whose generosity and goodwill has resulted in a not inconsiderable number of flowers being added to this treatise which otherwise would not have been included.

Europeans eagerly collected exotic flora from the Americas because such plants were highly valued for their medicinal and culinary properties, in addition to being foreign curiosities and status symbols. That practice of “collecting” natural resources, known as [extractive colonialism](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-2015/a-typology-of-colonialism), often involved violent confrontations with indigenous inhabitants.

### “I’ll Follow the Sun”: Heliotropism as Myth and Metaphor

Heliotropism in plants was observed by the ancient Greeks and this phenomenon is a central conceit in the myth of Clytie and Helios. Explain the myth. The associations of the sunflower in this narrative with notions of WHAT proved influential in Western European art and culture. Introduce idea of constancy and then connect to heliotropism.

<param ve-entity eid="Q1602587" title="heliotropism" aliases="heliotropic">
Having dispelled several cultural myths about the sunflower, we now turn to another. It is widely believed that sunflowers are heliotropic throughout their lives. In actuality, however, the plant only tracks the movement of the sun during an early phase of its development and, once mature, faces the east. Scientists recently examined the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenomena, publishing their exciting findings in 2016.Their study reveals that the stems of immature plants elongate on opposite sides in a circadian rhythm: the east side elongates to produce heliotropism during the day and the west side does so to reorient eastward at nighttime. This growth pattern results from different genes that are expressed in response to an internal clock or external light, and they also regulate the cessation of movement. These amazing adaptations have ecological advantages, too—whereas heliotropism enhances the growth of the immature sunflower, the fixed eastward position of the blooming sunflower elevates its temperature and contributes to an increase in pollinator visitation. Widespread coverage of those findings by the media no doubt generated new excitement about the plant in recent years.

### Out of One, Many

<param ve-entity eid="Q30765614" title="floret"> 
Our familiarity with the sunflower, both real and represented, may lead us to overlook the fact that its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, _Compositae_ (_Asteraceae_), produces a special kind of inflorescence that is a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets. This diagram of a mature flower head shows that its disk consists of florets and that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets. The disk florets, which number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own seed after pollination. Although these traits may come as a surprise to us, botanical illustrators developed an iconography to communicate information about them in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

This hand-colored print _Anatomy of the Sunflower_, based on a design by the artist Peter Henderson, exemplifies a sophisticated understanding of the plant. Henderson shows a partial view of two mature plants—one facing back, and the other nearly front—to communicate valuable information about their dorsal and ventral anatomical structures, while taking some aesthetic liberties to imbue the flower heads with a sense of movement and vitality. <span data-click-image-zoomto="982,2706,2213,1795">At the center of the left flower,</span> a series of green scallop- and flame-like shapes describe how bracts, or modified leaves, grow in concentric layers.

Henderson’s design for _Anatomy of the Sunflower_ also articulates Linnaeus’s contributions to botany as they relate to _Helianthus_. Linnaeus developed a plant taxonomy that he based on the number, arrangement, and similarities of reproductive organs: stamen(s) and pistil(s). The tremendous influence of this system on the production of knowledge about and portrayal of plants is evident in the <span data-click-image-zoomto="2862,4454,2123,1782">lower right corner of _Anatomy of the Sunflower_,</span> where there are precise depictions of such organs.

The pictures not only show us different species, but also model for us a kind of aesthetic and phenomenological attentiveness to the plant world to which we ought to aspire.

As this map shows, the native range of _Helianthus_ stretches from British Columbia to southwest Mexico, though the plant has been introduced nearly worldwide. Sunflowers are a popular oil crop because their seeds are rich in nutrients and relatively low in fatty acids. After oil is extracted from seeds, the byproducts are repurposed for use as animal feed or, in the case of hulls, ground to produce roughage or fuel. Sunflower crops also provide seeds for confectionary food and birdfeed. In the X century, the sunflower became a favored oil crop in Russia because it was one of the few sources of protein that the Orthodox Church did not ban during Lent. Farmers in Russia bred a giant sunflower—NAME—that to increase seed yields. That species was introduced to North America in the mid twentieth century and it is the one most widely cultivated there today. In addition to those uses, sunflowers are cultivated as ornamentals for domestic settings, and EN Because sunflowers are able to extract harmful containments from soil and water, a process known as phytoremediation, they have been planted at the sites of the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi disasters to absorb radiation.
