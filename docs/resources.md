### MapWarper

[MapWarper](https://mapwarper.net/) is a free and open-source tool for **georectification**.  Georectification is the process of taking an image of a map and referencing it to a spatial grid, so that the image of the map can be used as a layer in other maps, or so that the image of the map can in turn be used for associating points of interest with the spatial grid.  For visual essays this is often used to generate historical map overlays for geographical regions of interest.
