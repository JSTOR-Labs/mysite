### Herbs and Women’s Health

### An Ancient Herb from an Ancient Tradition
Dittany has been used as a medicinal herb, particularly for women’s health, for more than 2,000 years. Roman stateman and naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote:
>"But it is dittany that is of the greatest efficacy in cases of this description; it acts as an emmenagogue, and is an expellent of the fœtus when dead or lying transversely in the uterus. In these cases the leaves of it are taken, in doses of one obolus, in water: indeed so active is it in its effects that ordinarily it is forbidden to be introduced into the chamber of a woman lying-in. Not only is it thus efficacious when taken in drink, but even when applied topically or used as a fumigation. Pseudodictamnum possesses pretty nearly the same virtues, but it acts as an emmenagogue also, boiled in doses of one denarius in unmixed wine." 
In his description, Pliny mentions two types of dittany—"dittany” and “Pseudodictamnum,” also known as bastard (or false) dittany. While both types of dittany worked as an emmenagogue (to induce menstruation) or to help expel a fetus, as the name suggested, pseudo or bastard dittany was considered less potent. Pliny’s work, alongside other Roman authors such as Galen and Dioscorides, built off the works of Classical Greek authors, mostly centering on the teachings of Hippocrates. Collectively, these works, known as the Hippocratic Collection, became the foundation of western herbal medicine for more than a millennium. 

By the beginning of the Medieval period, the works of classical authors were continuously collected and reproduced to create a genre of manuscripts known collectively as herbals. Today, we define herbals as a family of related books produced by naturalists, physicians, and proto botanists that identify and describe plants through text and/or illustrations and explain plants’ medicinal virtues, often incorporating local or indigenous knowledge as well as recipes for therapeutic preparations. As a genre, herbals were also highly interconnected. Authors of herbals routinely cited one another, commented on, or translated previously published herbals, synthesizing information on plant nomenclature, origin, and botanical lore in the process.

One such lore was the power of dittany for women’s health. According to Dioscorides, arguably the most influential ancient author on medicinal herbs, “diktamnos” was a hot plant with woolly leaves, and only true dittany grew on the island of Crete. Like Pliny, Dioscorides described the medical virtues of dittany (and bastard dittany) for women, which he said when drunk, used as suppository/pessary, or burned as incense had the power to expel a dead fetus. Dioscorides’s De Materia Medica served as the foundational text for most European herbal manuscripts. As such, Dioscorides’s description of dittany as well as his claim that it had the power to quicken birth and expel a dead fetus was repeated in Medieval herbal manuscripts as well as early modern printed herbals. 

By the early modern period, dittany was often described in herbals in three forms. The first was true dittany, a rare herb which grew only on rocky cliffs on the island of Crete. The second was white dittany (sometimes called fraxinella) and the third was bastard or false dittany. Today, these correlate to three different species across three related genera—Origanum dictamnus, Dictamnus albus, and Ballota pseudodictamnus respectively. While we now classify dittany of the ancient world as three distinct species, in early modern herbals the main difference between the three was origin and, most importantly, potency. All three types of dittany, however, continued to be classified as a potent emmenagogue, x, and x in early modern herbals.
