## The Plant Humanities Initiative
Welcome to the ***Plant Humanities*** visual essays prototype site. This site provides tools for tagging and viewing textual narratives. The tagged narratives enable interactive visualizations that augment the textual content with maps, videos, and hi-resolution images. This site has been developed in support of the [*Plant Humanities Initiative*](https://labs.jstor.org/planthumanities/), a collaboration between [Dumbarton Oaks](https://www.doaks.org/) and [JSTOR Labs](https://labs.jstor.org), generously funded by [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/).
