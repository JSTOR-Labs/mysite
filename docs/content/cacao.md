## Cacao: An indigenous network and global commodity

### Introduction

<![endif]-->

While colonial encounters are often conceptualized as a one-way street, with the colonizers subjugating the colonized, the historical picture is more complex. During the early modern period, Europeans sought to benefit from new economic goods and networks. To do so, their integration into the other cultural spheres of foreign lands was necessary. This meant learning about indigenous perspectives and knowledge, which Europeans exploited for their own benefit both in the New World and eventually back in their homelands, ultimately ‘globalizing’ said indigenous networks. One of the most famous prehistoric networks that Europeans made efforts to control was that of cacao, _Theobroma cacao_, and the primary sources from this time period document the knowledge they gained from the native populations of the Americas.

### Early recipes

After contact, the earliest representations of cacao come from a Mexica (Aztec) herbal known as the Badianus manuscript, a series of elaborately painted plants with their associated names in Nahuatl and recipes for treating various ailments written in Latin.[^ref1] The creation of this herbal was completed in the 1550s by at least two Nahua men, Martín de la Cruz (a physician) and Juan Badiano (ainstructor), at a European-funded and established school, Santa Cruz in Tlatelolco, Mexico. It is in this beautifully created herbal that historically deep and broader indigenous ideologies are captured.[^ref2] <var data-map title="World" data-center="19.431947, -99.133335" data-zoom="4"></var>

A fruiting cacao tree, identified as *Tlapalcacautl* in Nahautl, features in a recipe entitled “Trees and flowers for the fatigue of those administering the government and holding public office”.[^ref3] The other representation of cacao found in the text, identified as *Cacauaxochitl* in Nahautl, shows the plant in flower.[^ref4] This painting is featured with a recipe for “Mental Stupor” that calls for the use of the bark and roots of a flowered cacao. This same flowered cacao tree (*Cacauaxochitl*), while not illustrated, features in recipes for hurt feet and as a cure for fear. Not only do the watercolors present anatomically accurate plant structures, they also represent the ecology in which the plants grow.[^ref5] These details of the herbal clearly indicate that the Mexica had a broad understanding of botanical biology and ecology, a level of knowledge not represented in contemporaneous herbals of the time from European writers.

### Ancient ideologies

In these indigenous herbal remedies, the association of cacao with fearlessness, political governance, and ultimately power echoes what is known about ideologies surrounding cacao for thousands of years prior from Olmec, Maya, and other Mesoamerican cultures.[^ref6] In several Mesoamerican ideologies, the plant itself represented an important stage in the life cycle of the natural world, emerging after the death of maize. This cycle has been referred to as a forest garden or milpa, a subsistence strategy that was central to providing sustenance to millions of neotropical inhabitants.[^ref7] The milpa strategy is a process of felling, burning, planting, and harvesting a plot of land that, after a few years, is left to ‘fallow’.[^ref8] and harvesting a plot of land that, after a few years, is left to ‘fallow’. Although, this would not be a fallow in the traditional sense of the word where land is left uncultivated and untouched. Instead, certain useful trees, such as cacao, and plants were encouraged to grow in what would have looked like ‘wild’ plots to Europeans.

Maya leaders embodied the power of this cycle by representing themselves as, or in relation to, it and its associated plants of importance. For example, we see the ancient Maya depict [the ancestors of rulers as cacao trees growing from the sarcophagi of dead ‘maize god’ rulers](https://library-artstor-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/#/asset/ARTSTOR_103_41822000267326&fs) and [cacao trees anthropomorphized as deities](museum.doaks.org/Obj22807?sid=30693&x=51741&port=2652). By invoking this cycle in representing themselves, the deities, and their prestige, these political leaders were giving precedence and power to the subsistence practices and plants it entailed. Thus, the understanding of cacao as invoking or emerging from power and prestige has a broader spatio-temporal history, developing well before the arrival of Spaniards and the creation of the school in which de la Cruz and Badiano created the herbal.

The presence of cacao in a remedy for hurt feet within the Badianus wittily echoes the realities of indigenous economic networks. Without beasts of burden, the long-distance transport of cacao from the neotropics to the Mexica capital would have certainly caused one’s feet to ache. In [Hernán Cortés’ conquistador accounts](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427885396$228i), several regions are recognized for their tribute of cacao to the Mexica empire including Huauthla, Soconusco, and Cotaxtla, all of which are hundreds of miles from the capital. We learn from many other early colonial documents that roasted cacao beans were used as a currency throughout Mesoamerican history, highlighting how important a trade good this plant would have been. The political prowess needed to build and maintain the production and exchange networks associated with cacao would have certainly manufactured powerful polities across the neotropics.

     data-mapwarper-id="45365"
     data-active="true"></var>

Eventually, these networks created a taste for cacao in far-reaching lands that maintained the high status and importance of neotropical polities during ancient and historic periods.[^ref9],[^ref10] This relationship between long-distance trade and cacao is also reflected in the ancient Maya God L, who is often depicted in relation to cacao and merchant regalia.[^ref11]  Ultimately, the ancient association of commerce with cacao suggests that the neotropics have a deep history with long-distance trade between the many regions of Mesoamerica and that cacao was likely a source of power and prestige for those occupying the environs where it could best grow. It is no wonder that ancient rulers invoked cacao in their ritual and political exchanges and ceremonies, which often included the imbibing of cacao beverages or the [gifting of cacao vessels](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/viewallcomponentmetadata/L/HVD_VIA8001542575?vid=HVD2&tab=everything&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine).[^ref12],[^ref13]

### European Accounts

The Spanish and other Europeans found themselves needing to understand and participate in these indigenous networks and ideologies to fulfill their colonial agendas, thus giving initial agency to this native perspective. With the continued subjugation and conversion of indigenous populations, we eventually lose access to this emic native perspective in colonial period texts. However, we see interest in indigenous plants from foreign lands reflected in European-made herbals from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Cacao features in several of these, but not in some one might expect. At first thought, it is surprising that cacao does not appear in any of [the several, early Iberian-made herbals by Nicolás Monardes](https://search-proquest-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/docview/2090357043/?pq-origsite=primo). However, since Monardes was Spain-based and never left the hemisphere, he was only aware of plants that would have reached him from across the ocean via his naturalist network. He also only seems to have reported plants he was able to propagate in his garden or use for himself, as he repeatedly claims his findings are based on real and personal observations. Given these facts, it is unlikely that cacao seeds would have survived the voyage across the Atlantic let alone propagation in the drier Mediterranean climate of Seville, where Monardes was based.

We do see cacao in [John Gerard’s The Herball from 1597](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/57082419), referenced in Latin as *Beretinus fructus*. Gerard mentions that this plant was used by the native populations encountered by Sir Frances Drake to pay tribute to their political leaders, again echoing the deep ideologies associating cacao with economic and political networks. It is here that we learn of a cacao specimen brought to England by Sir Drake. [John Parkinson’s 1640 volume](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/56601545) adds to our information in that these cacao specimens were brought by Sir Frances Drake after his 1580 voyage. Some of them eventually found their way to [Carolus Clusius](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/13558)by means of a Master Garth and Master Morgan.[^ref14] 

Interestingly, Parkinson [has a duplicate entry for cacao](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/56601539), but under a different name: “Cacao sive Cacaute” or “Peare bearing wholesome Almond tree”. It is stated that this plant is made into a beverage called “Chocolate” in an unspecified indigenous language, likely the linguistic origins of our modern name for the creamy, satisfying paste made from cacao. This second entry references a different source, “Benzo”, probably the 1572 account of [Girolamo Benzoni](https://books.google.com/books?id=lmcMAAAAIAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=Historia%20del%20Mondo%20Nuovo&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q&f=false), which again alludes to the use of cacao as money and describes the methods to create the cacao beverage. Perhaps because Benzoni actually visited the region, his first-hand account actually references the ecology in which cacao grows: only very warm, moist, and shady areas. It is likely that these exotic ecological constraints added to the appeal of cacao, both for the Mexica and later the Europeans, because of the prestige associated with commanding such a network.

### Conclusion

The political and economic powers of Europe took note of these early accounts of cacao as monetarily and ideological valuable and, by the 17th century, international markets were emerging, maintained largely through African slave labor.[^ref15] The tastes of returning merchants and clergy to Spain, as well as its reported medicinal properties, allowed cacao to take off in Spain by the early 17th century.[^ref16],[^ref17] In other parts of Europe, cacao and even [special cacao vessels](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/viewallcomponentmetadata/L/HVD_VIAHUAM229275?vid=HVD2&tab=everything&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine) featured prominently in [elite networks](https://books.google.it/books?id=D6n6jyFAUf4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Francesco+Redi+Bacco&hl=it&sa=X&ei=ocYRVfyIIcX_ygOf_ILwBw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false), again invoking the ideologies rooted in distant places and eras of Mesoamerica. At a time when curiosities fueled the exploration and description of the natural and cultural world, cacao featured quite prominently as a curio to add to [royal cabinets](https://books.google.it/books?id=9e1y1RicMDYC&dq=Vallisneri%20A.%20Dell'uso%20e%20dell'Abuso%20delle%20Bevande%20e%20Bagnature%20calde&hl=it&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false). Eventually, cacao found its way into products meant to entice the common palate including the many chocolate bars, desserts, and drinks we know and love today. Cacao continues to be grown in the tropics across the world today, both for global and local markets[^ref18],[^ref19] Despite the colonial agenda to convert indigenous populations to European lifestyles, the ideological association of cacao with subsistence, prestige, and trade has continued across millennia and cultures, making the power and appeal of cacao truly timeless and global.

It is likely Parkinson was reading and using Clusius to construct his large *Theatrum Botanicum*. At this point in history, it seems there had been enough accounts of exotic plants to create some confusion regarding their names and how to differentiate or combine them. This was probably due to the fact that these authors were referencing other’s observations or that they were only privy to viewing a single part of the plant, usually the seeds, and not in its natural habitat.
