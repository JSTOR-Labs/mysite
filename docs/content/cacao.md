### Introduction

One of the most salient indigenous networks that colonial Europeans made efforts to control was that of cacao, _Theobroma cacao_. While such endeavors are often conceptualized as a one-way street, with colonizers subjugating the colonized, the historical picture is more complex.  The early modern period saw Europeans seeking to benefit from new economic goods and networks in the Americas. Yet, economies do not function in a vacuum and, to truly benefit, they had to assimilate into the other cultural spheres of foreign lands. This meant learning about native perspectives and knowledge, which Europeans exploited for their own benefit both in the New World and eventually back in their homelands, ultimately ‘globalizing’ pre-existing indigenous networks. The primary sources from this initial period of interaction document the knowledge gained from native populations of the Americas about the coveted plant known to produce the infamous _xocoatl_.

### Early Recipes

After contact, the  earliest  representations of cacao come from  a Mexica herbal known as  the  Badianus  manuscript, a series of elaborately painted plants with their associated  names  in Nahuatl  and  recipes for treating various ailments  written in Latin.  This herbal  was  completed  in the 1550s  by at least two  Nahua men,  Martín  de la Cruz (an indigenous nobleman and physician) and Juan  Badiano  (an instructor of Latin),  at a European-funded and -established  school, Colegio Santa Cruz  in Tlatelolco, Mexico. Now held by the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City, the manuscript has been reproduced in a diversity of ways since its original creation.[^ref1] In these created and recreated pieces, historically deep and broader indigenous ideologies surrounding _Theobroma cacao_ are captured.[^ref2]

A fruiting cacao tree, identified as *Tlapalcacautl* in Nahautl, features in a recipe entitled “Trees and flowers for the fatigue of those administering the government and holding public office”.[^ref3] The other representation of cacao found in the text, identified as *Cacauaxochitl* in Nahautl, shows the plant in flower.[^ref4] While previous scholars have identified the latter plant as _Quararibea funebris_ because of the similarity of the Nahuatl name given with that of [one described by](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42728812) Francisco Hernández de Toledo, the deep orange and yellow flowers along with the overall structure of the petals, pistil, and stamen depicted actually support the identification of it as a flowering and budding _Theobroma cacao_.[^ref5] illustration is featured with a recipe for  “Mental Stupor”, which calls for the use of its bark and roots. This same flowered cacao, while not illustrated, also features in recipes for hurt feet and as a cure for fear.

It is clear that the watercolors  illustrate  anatomically accurate plant  structures situated within particular stages of the reproductive life cycle of cacao. These details of the herbal indicate  that the Mexica  had an intimate understanding of  the biology of cacao, a  level of knowledge not represented  in contemporaneous European-authored herbals. Consequently, the knowledge of cacao within the Badianus has a broader spatio-temporal history, developing across Mesoamerica well before the arrival of Spaniards and the formation of the school in which de la Cruz and Badiano created the herbal.

### Ancient Ideologies

In these Mexica recipes, the association of cacao with curing particular ailments echoes what was known about the plant for thousands of years by preceding Mesoamerican cultures. In several indigenous cosmologies, the  cacao plant represented  an important stage in the life cycle of  the environment,  emerging after the death of maize. This cycle has  been referred to as a forest garden or milpa, a subsistence strategy that was, and still is, central to providing sustenance to millions of neotropical inhabitants. [^ref6]
<var data-image-viewer></var>
<var data-image id="The Milpa Cycle" title="" data-url="https://jstor-labs.github.io/plant-humanities/images/MilpaCycle.png" data-fit="fill"></var>

Ancient Maya leaders represented themselves and their gods as or in relation to this cycle and its  associated  plants  of importance, mainly cacao and maize, attempting to embody the power of the natural world. For example, we see the  ancient Maya  depict ancestors of rulers  as cacao trees  growing from the sarcophagi of dead  ‘maize god’  rulers at the site of Palenque  and  cacao trees anthropomorphized  as deities on intricately carved vessels. By invoking this cycle in representing themselves and deities, Maya political leaders were giving precedence to the subsistence practices, ideologies, and plants they incorporated.  Given this ancient association of cacao with the power of the natural world, it is not surprising to see cacao as an ingredient in the Badianus’ recipes for curing fear and malaise, particularly for political leaders.

The presence of cacao in a remedy for hurt feet within the Badianus also wittily illustrates the realities of  indigenous  Mesoamerican lifeways. Without beasts of burden, the  long-distance transport of cacao from the neotropics to Tenochtitlan, the Mexica capital, would have certainly caused one’s feet to ache.  For example, in [Hernán Cortés’s conquistador accounts](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427885396$229i), several regions are recognized for their tribute of cacao to the Mexica empire including  Huauthla,  Soconusco, and  Cotaxtla, all of which are hundreds of miles from Tenochtitlan.[^ref8]

We learn from many other early colonial documents that roasted cacao beans were used as a currency throughout Mesoamerica, highlighting how  important of an economic good  this plant would have been by the time Europeans arrived. This relationship between long-distance trade and cacao is also reflected in the ancient Maya God L, who is typically depicted in relation to cacao and merchant regalia.[^ref9] Such an ancient  association of  commerce with cacao emphasizes the deep history of long-distan ce of the plant between the many regions of Mesoamerica.

Ultimately, the ideological importance of cacao within political, social, and economic realms of these cultures serves as support for the idea of a ritual economy, where the production and exchange of goods were intimately connected to the  ideological realm.[^ref10] These archaeological data regarding cacao indicate that individuals and polities would have sought control of its associated production and exchange networks to garner power, perpetuating its uses and ideologies farther and farther from their neotropical origins.  It is no wonder that ancient rulers invoked cacao in their ritual and political exchanges and ceremonies, which often included the imbibing of cacao beverages or the  gifting of cacao vessels.[^ref11][^ref12] Eventually, these practices created a taste for cacao across an elaborate network of Mesoamerican polities, maintaining the high status and importance of cacao-producing regions during ancient and historic periods.[^ref13][^ref14] Upon European arrival, these networks of production and trade as well as their associated ideologies and practices were well-established across the Americas.

### European Accounts

To fulfill colonial agendas, the Spanish and other Europeans found themselves in need of understanding and participating in these indigenous networks and ideologies of the Americas. This need initially gave a measure of agency to  the  native  perspective, as reflected through the creation of texts like the Badianus.  With the continued subjugation  and conversion of indigenous populations, we eventually lose access to this  emic  native perspective in European-sponsored texts of the colonial  period. However, we gain access to knowledge of New World plants through European-perspective  manuscripts from the late 16th  and early 17th  centuries.  Cacao features in several of these, but not in some one might expect.
<var data-image id="Rivera Mural" title="Diego Rivera Mural depicting an Auto de Fe of indigenous literature and idols" data-url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Murales_Rivera_-_Treppenhaus_9_B%C3%BCcherverbrennung.jpg"></var>

At first thought, it is surprising  that cacao does  not  appear  in  any  of  the  [several herbals on New World plants by Nicolás  Monardes](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/13636). However, since  Monardes  was based in Seville and  never left the  hemisphere, he was only aware of  plants  that would have reached  him  from across the ocean via his network of fellow naturalists. He also seems to have only reported the plants he was able to propagate in his garden or use for himself,  as he  repeatedly  claims  his findings are based on real  and personal  observations. Given these facts, it is unlikely that cacao  seeds would have sustained their reproductive capacity after a voyage across the Atlantic, let alone propagation in the drier Mediterranean climate of Seville.

     data-active="true"></var>

Yet, cacao made it to England by the end of the 16th century, when the well-known herbalist John Gerard features it under the Latin name  [_Beretinus_  _fructus_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/57082419) in his 1597 _The Herball_. It is in this herbal that we learn cacao specimens were brought to England by Sir Francis Drake.  Gerard mentions that  Sir Drake observed the native populations using this plant to pay tribute to their  political leaders, again echoing the deep-rooted ideologies associating cacao with  economic and political networks. [John Parkinson’s 1640 _Theatrum Botanicum_](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/56601544) adds that these cacao specimens were brought by Sir Francis Drake specifically after his 1580 voyage. Some of them also eventually  found their way to Carolus Clusius in Leiden by means of Master Richard Garth, an officer of the Court of Chancery in London, and Master Hugh Morgan, the apothecary to Queen Elizabeth I. These world-traveling cacao specimens were then used by Clusius to create [at least one of his two mentions of the plant](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/13558) in his 1604 herbal, _Exoticorum libri decem_.[^ref15]

Interestingly, Parkinson also has a [duplicate entry for cacao](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/56601539), but under the name “Cacao sive Cacaute” or “Peare bearing wholesome Almond tree.” It is stated that this plant is made into a beverage called “Chocolate” in an unspecified indigenous language, revealing that our modern name for the creamy, satisfying paste made from cacao has its linguistic origins in the New World.  This second entry references a different source, “Benzo,” likely the 1565 _Historia del Mondo Nuovo_ by Girolamo Benzoni, [where he discusses his encounters with cacao in the Americas](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Etlmh2F9VucC&hl=en&pg=GBS.PT216).
<var data-image id="bhl-56601539" title="Theatrum Botanicum p. 1642" data-url="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageimage/56601539" data-region="1667,1240,2190,1890"></var>
<var data-image id="bhl-8066123" title="Carolus Clusius' mentions of _Beretinus_ _fructus_ and _Cacao_ _fructus_" data-url="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageimage/8066123" data-region="1667,1240,2190,1890"></var>

In his text, Benzoni refers to the use of cacao as money and describes the methods to create the cacao beverage. Because Benzoni actually visited the region, which he identifies as Nicaragua, his first-hand account  references the ecology in which cacao grows: only very warm, moist, and shady areas. It is likely that these exotic ecological constraints added to the appeal of cacao, both for the Mexica and later the Europeans, because of the prestige associated with commanding such a limited network.

### Conclusion

The political and economic powers of Europe took note of these early accounts of cacao as monetarily and ideologically valuable and, by the 17th  century, international markets were emerging, maintained largely through African slave labor.[^ref16][^ref17] The tastes of returning merchants and clergy, as well as cacao's reported medicinal properties, allowed it to take off in Spain by the early 17th century.[^ref18][^ref19] In other parts of Europe, the chocolate beverage and its associated dishware featured prominently in elite networks, invoking ideologies rooted in distant places and eras of Mesoamerica. At a time when curiosities fueled the exploration and description of the natural and cultural world, cacao featured quite prominently as a curio to add to royal cabinets.[^ref20] Cacao also found its way into commercial products meant to entice the common palate including the many chocolate bars, desserts, and drinks we know and love today. _Theobroma cacao_ continues to be grown in the tropics across the world today, both for global and local markets.[^ref21][^ref22][^ref23] The ideological association of cacao with subsistence, prestige, and trade has continued across millennia and cultures, making the power and appeal of it truly timeless and global.

[^ref15]: Like Parkinson, Clusius has two entries that are likely cacao:  _Beretinus fructus_  and  _Cacao fructus_. The former being from accounts of Drake’s explorations and the latter referencing a Benzonem, likely Benzoni. It is probable that Parkinson was reading and using Clusius, along with Gerard and others, to construct his large  _Theatrum Botanicum_. At this point in history, there had been enough reports of exotic plants to create some confusion regarding their names and how to differentiate or combine them. This confusion was amplified both by the fact that these authors were referencing other’s observations and that they were typically only privy to viewing a single part of the plant, usually the seeds, and not in its natural habitat.
