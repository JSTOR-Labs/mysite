## Cacao: An indigenous network and global commodity
 
### Introduction

While colonial encounters are often conceptualized as a one-way street, with the colonizers subjugating the colonized, the historical picture is more complex. During the early modern period, Europeans sought to benefit from new economic goods and networks in the Americas. However, economies do not function in a vacuum and, to truly benefit, Europeans had to assimilate into the other cultural spheres of foreign lands. This meant learning about indigenous perspectives and knowledge, which Europeans exploited for their own benefit both in the New World and eventually back in their homelands, ultimately ‘globalizing’ pre-existing indigenous networks. One of the most famous indigenous networks that Europeans made efforts to control was that of cacao, _Theobroma cacao_. The primary sources from this initial period of interaction document the knowledge gained from the native populations of the Americas.

### Early recipes

After contact, the  earliest  representations of cacao come from  a Mexica (Aztec) herbal known as  the  Badianus  manuscript, a series of elaborately painted plants with their associated  names  in Nahuatl  and  recipes for treating various ailments  written in Latin.  This herbal  was  completed  in the 1550s  by at least two  Nahua men,  Martín  de la Cruz (an indigenous nobleman and physician) and Juan  Badiano  (an instructor of Latin),  at a European-funded and  established  school, Santa Cruz  in Tlatelolco, Mexico. Now held by the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City, the manuscript has been reproduced in a diversity of ways since its original creation.[^ref1] In these elaborately created and recreated pieces, historically deep and broader indigenous ideologies are captured.[^ref2]

A fruiting cacao tree, identified as *Tlapalcacautl* in Nahautl, features in a recipe entitled “Trees and flowers for the fatigue of those administering the government and holding public office”.[^ref3] The other representation of cacao found in the text, identified as *Cacauaxochitl* in Nahautl, shows the plant in flower.[^ref4] While previous scholars have identified this plant as _Quararibea funebris_ because of the similarity of the Nahuatl name given with that of one described by Francisco Hernández de Toledo, the deep orange and yellow petals along with the overall structure of the petals, pistil, and stamen depicted actually support the identification of it as a flowering and budding _Theobroma cacao_.[^ref5] The _Cacauaxochitl_ illustration is featured with a recipe for  “Mental Stupor” that calls for the use of its bark and roots. This same flowered cacao tree  (_Cacauaxochitl_), while not illustrated,  also features in recipes for hurt feet and as a cure for fear.

It is clear that the watercolors  illustrate  anatomically accurate plant  structures situated within particular stages of the reproductive life cycle of cacao. These details of the herbal indicate  that the Mexica  had a detailed understanding of  the biology of cacao, a  level of knowledge not represented  in contemporaneous European-authored herbals. Consequently, the knowledge of cacao within the Badianus has a broader spatio-temporal history, developing well before the arrival of Spaniards and the formation of the school in which de la Cruz and Badiano created the herbal.

### Ancient ideologies

In these Mexica recipes, the association of cacao with curing particular ailments echoes  what is known about the plant for thousands of years from preceding Mesoamerican cultures. In several indigenous cosmologies, the  cacao plant represented  an important stage in the life cycle of  the environment,  emerging after the death of maize. This cycle has  been referred to as a forest garden or milpa, a subsistence strategy that was, and still is, central to providing sustenance to millions of neotropical inhabitants. [^ref6] 
<var data-map title="World" data-center="19.431947, -99.133335" data-zoom="5"></var>
<var data-map-layer

<var data-image-viewer></var>  
<var data-image id="Mesoamerica" title="Mesoamerica" data-url="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mesoamerica_topographic_map-blank.svg"></var>

The milpa cycle is  a  process  of felling, burning, planting, and harvesting a plot of land that,  after a few years,  is left to ‘fallow.’[^ref7] However, this would not be fallow in the traditional sense of the word indicating that land is left uncultivated and untouched. Instead, certain useful plants, such as cacao, were encouraged to grow in what would have looked to Europeans like ‘wild’ plots. After this stage, the cycle would restart, where some plants would be left to grow, others would be pulled and burnt, and staple crops would be planted in the ashes to eventually be harvested.

Ancient Maya leaders represented themselves as or in relation to this cycle and its  associated  plants  of importance, mainly cacao and maize, attempting to embody the power of the natural world. For example, we see the  ancient Maya  depict ancestors of rulers  as cacao trees  growing from the sarcophagi of dead  ‘maize god’  rulers at the site of Palenque  and  cacao trees anthropomorphized  as deities on intricately carved vessels. By invoking this cycle in representing themselves and deities, Maya political leaders were giving precedence to the subsistence practices, ideologies, and plants they incorporated.  Given this ancient association of cacao with the power of the natural world, it is not surprising to see cacao as an ingredient in the Badianus’ recipes for curing fear and malaise, particularly for political leaders.

The presence of cacao in a remedy for hurt feet within the Badianus also wittily illustrates the realities of  indigenous  Mesoamerican lifeways. Without beasts of burden, the  long-distance transport of cacao from the neotropics to Tenochtitlan, the Mexica capital, would have certainly caused one’s feet to ache.  For example, in  Hernán Cortés’ conquistador accounts, several regions are recognized for their tribute of cacao to the Mexica empire including  Huauthla,  Soconusco, and  Cotaxtla, all of which are hundreds of miles from Tenochtitlan.[^ref8]

We learn from many other early colonial documents that roasted cacao beans were used as a currency throughout Mesoamerica, highlighting how  important a  trade good  this plant would have been by the time Europeans arrived. This relationship between long-distance trade and cacao is also reflected in the ancient Maya God L, who is typically depicted in relation to cacao and merchant regalia.[^ref9] Such an ancient  association of  commerce with cacao emphasizes the deep history of long-distance trade of the plant between the many regions of Mesoamerica.

Ultimately, the importance of cacao within political, social, and economic realms of these cultures indicates that individuals and polities would have sought control of its associated production and exchange networks to garner power, perpetuating its uses and ideologies farther and farther from their neotropical origins.  It is no wonder that ancient rulers invoked cacao in their ritual and political exchanges and ceremonies, which often included the imbibing of cacao beverages or the  gifting of cacao vessels.[^ref10][^ref11] Eventually, these practices created a taste for cacao across an elaborate network of Mesoamerican polities, maintaining the high status and importance of cacao-producing regions during ancient and historic periods.[^ref12][^ref13] Upon European arrival, these networks of production and trade as well as their associated ideologies and practices were well-established across the Americas.

### European Accounts

To fulfill their colonial agendas, the Spanish and other Europeans  found themselves in need of understanding and participating in the indigenous networks and ideologies of the Americas. This need initially gave a measure of agency to  the  native  perspective, as reflected through the creation of texts like the Badianus.  With the continued subjugation  and conversion of indigenous populations, we eventually lose access to this  emic  native perspective in texts of the colonial  period. However, we gain access to knowledge of New World plants through European-perspective  manuscripts from the late 16th  and early 17th  centuries.  Cacao features in several of these, but not in some one might expect.

At first thought, it is surprising  that cacao does  not  appear  in  any  of  the  several, early  Iberian-made  herbals by Nicolás  Monardes. However, since  Monardes  was Spain-based and  never left the  hemisphere, he was only aware of  plants  that would have reached  him  from across the ocean via his network of fellow naturalists. He also seems to have reported solely on plants he was able to propagate in his garden or use for himself,  as he  repeatedly  claims  his findings are based on real  and personal  observations. Given these facts, it is unlikely that cacao  seeds would have survived the voyage across the Atlantic, let alone propagation in the drier Mediterranean climate of Seville, where  Monardes  was based.

We do see cacao in  John Gerard’s _The Herball_ from 1597, referenced  in Latin as _Beretinus_  _fructus_.  Gerard mentions  that this plant was used by the native  populations encountered by Sir Frances Drake to pay tribute to their  political leaders, again echoing the deep-rooted ideologies associating cacao with  economic and political networks.  It is here that we learn of a cacao specimen brought to England by Sir Drake. John Parkinson’s 1640 volume adds to our knowledge about these cacao specimens, indicating that they were brought by Sir Frances Drake  after his 1580 voyage. Some of them eventually  found their way to Carolus  Clusius by means of a Master Garth and Master Morgan.[^ref14]

Interestingly, Parkinson  has a duplicate entry for cacao, but under a different name: “Cacao sive Cacaute” or “Peare bearing wholesome Almond tree.” It is stated that this plant is made into a beverage called “Chocolate” in an unspecified indigenous language, revealing that our modern name for the creamy, satisfying paste made from cacao has its linguistic origins in the New World.  This second entry references a different source, “Benzo,” probably the 1572 account of Girolamo  Benzoni, where he discusses his encounters with cacao in Nicaragua.
<var data-image id="bhl-56601539" title="Theatrum Botanicum p. 1642" data-url="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageimage/56601539" data-region="1667,1240,2190,1890"></var>

In his text, Benzoni refers to the use of cacao as money and describes the methods to create the cacao beverage. Perhaps because Benzoni actually visited the region, his first-hand account actually references the ecology in which cacao grows: only very warm, moist, and shady areas. It is likely that these exotic ecological constraints added to the appeal of cacao, both for the Mexica and later the Europeans, because of the prestige associated with commanding such a network.

### Conclusion

The political and economic powers of Europe took note of these early accounts of cacao as monetarily and ideological valuable and, by the 17th  century, international markets were emerging, maintained largely through African slave labor.[^ref15],[^ref16] The tastes of returning merchants and clergy, as well as its reported medicinal properties, allowed cacao to take off in Spain by the early 17th century.[^ref17],[^ref18] In other parts of Europe, cacao and its associated dishware featured prominently in elite networks, invoking ideologies rooted in distant places and eras of Mesoamerica. At a time when curiosities fueled the exploration and description of the natural and cultural world, cacao featured quite prominently as a curio to add to royal cabinets.[^ref19] Cacao also found its way into commercial products meant to entice the common palate including the many chocolate bars, desserts, and drinks we know and love today. Cacao continues to be grown in the tropics across the world, both for global and local markets.[^ref20][^ref21] The ideological association of cacao with subsistence, prestige, and trade has continued across millennia and cultures, making the power and appeal of cacao truly timeless and global.

[^ref14]: Like Parkinson, Clusius has two entries that are likely cacao:  _Beretinus fructus_  and  _Cacao fructus_. The former being from accounts of Drake’s explorations and the latter referencing a Benzonem, likely Benzoni. It is probable that Parkinson was reading and using Clusius, along with Gerard and others, to construct his large  _Theatrum Botanicum_. At this point in history, there had been enough reports of exotic plants to create some confusion regarding their names and how to differentiate or combine them. This confusion was amplified both by the fact that these authors were referencing other’s observations and that they were typically only privy to viewing a single part of the plant, usually the seeds, and not in its natural habitat.
