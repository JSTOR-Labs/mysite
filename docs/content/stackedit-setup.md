### StackEdit
StackEdit is a browser-based tool for editing markdown files.  Files created/edited in StackEdit can be synchronized with or published to a variety of online sources, including Google Drive and Github.  The setup and usage instructions below describe the simplest setup for the one-way publishing of files to the https://github.com/jstor-labs/plant-humanities Github repository.

### Setup
To start using StackEdit to create/edit markdown files navigate to [https://stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io) where you should see a page like the following.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/stackedit-home.png" style="width:100%;max-width:400px;box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);border:1px solid #aaa;margin-bottom:6px;" ><br/>
  <span style="padding-top:24px;font-size:1.1em;font-weight:bold;">StackEdit Home Page</span>
</p>

On this page click the `START WRITING` header at the top.  The next page displayed should look something like this which is a welcome/help file that is automatically added to the default workspace.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/stackedit-welcome.png" style="width:100%;max-width:400px;box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);border:1px solid #aaa;margin-bottom:6px;" ><br/>
  <span style="padding-top:24px;font-size:1.1em;font-weight:bold;">StackEdit Welcome File</span>
</p>

This welcome file provides a general overview of how StackEdit can be used to synchronize and/or publish files to/with external locations.  For our purposes we will just be using the `Publish a File` capability to keep things simple, at least initially.

From the Welcome File page select the Folder icon at the top left of the page to open the **file explorer** pane.  From the file explorer files can be deleted, added and otherwise organized.  To add a new essay file click the add file icon at the top of the file explorer pane and give the new file a name.  Note that files published to our Github repository will require a `.md` file extension, adding this extension is optional when naming a file in the explorer.

If the file added to StackEdit already exists in the Github repository we'll need to manually add the file contents to the StackEdit copy.  To do this navigate to [https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/tree/master/docs/content](https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/tree/master/docs/content)  and select the applicable file.  After selecting the file Github will show the markdown file in a rendered form.  We will need the raw markdown text which can be viewed by selecting the `Raw` option from the toolbar near the top of the page.  From the raw content viewer copy all of the text and paste it into the StackEdit file just created.
