## Curcuma longa: The “Herb of the Sun” 

### Merit of the Earth? 
Turmeric’s status as a valuable medicinal plant has long been mythologized. Indeed, many juggernauts, including the _Oxford English Dictionary_, suggest that its etymology stems from an adulteration of the French trade-name “terre mérite.” Dr. William Guthrie, in a 2008 article, all but proved this etymology to be spurious, but it nonetheless illustrates how the root has been seen across the centuries: it is a plant of extreme value (mérite) from the earth (la terre).[^ref1]

While the “mérite” of terre mérite, as Dr. Guthrie noted, most likely refers to its medicinal value, turmeric has been esteemed for many other reasons. As the long history of turmeric and its consumption reveals, the root’s distinctive color and taste were integral parts of the colonial project as a mechanism through which British men and women could perform the ideological work of empire, or, in the words of historian Susan Zlotnick, “neutralize the threat of the Other by naturalizing the products of foreign lands.” [^ref2]

### Turmeric’s Origin Story

Turmeric’s roots are deeply embedded in the cultural landscape of South and Southeast Asia. It is unclear exactly where in South and Southeast Asia the root originated — different naturalists give different places of origin from present-day South India to Malaysia to Indonesia.

	data-active="true"></var>

Wherever its exact origin, anthropologists, historians, and botanists have long noted the cultural importance of turmeric. The spice has been in documented use for at least 6000 years, and in India, Vedic societies thought of it as “the herb of the sun” due to its yellow-orange color.[^ref3]  Many have identified turmeric as featuring in the [_Atharva Veda_](https://books.google.com/books?id=jz9OOpqHxiAC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=O%20colorer%2C%20do%20thou%20color%20this%20leprous%20spot%20and%20what%20is%20pale.%20The%20leprous%20spot%2C%20what%20is%20pale%2C%20do%20thou%20cause%20to%20diasappear.&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false), the Vedic hymn book providing recipes for healing medicines and spells. There, the hymn reads, “O colorer, do thou color this leprous spot and what is pale. The leprous spot, what is pale, do thou cause to diasappear.” The colorer, according to lexicographers, is commonly thought to be a reference to curcuma longa. Similarly, in [_Sushruta Samhita_](https://books.google.com/books?id=ixUpAAAAYAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=sushruta%20samhita%20leeches%20turmeric&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false), an Ayurvedic compendium, the author suggests treating leeches with a turmeric paste.  In addition to being medicinal, the root was also seen as regal. It featured as decoration in kingly feasts; there is documented evidence that King Kanthirava Narasaraja Rajendra was entertained by women whose faces were caked with turmeric.[^ref4]

The root quickly spread beyond South and Southeast Asia. After turmeric’s domestication in Southern Asia, it was diffused to Tahiti, Hawaii, and the Easter Islands, long before European colonization.[^ref5]

### Taking Root Westward

The exact date of turmeric's arrival in the West is unclear. Some scholars claim that turmeric was mentioned by Dioscorides, demonstrating its presence in European empires during the Classical period. Nevertheless, before the Medieval period, turmeric was not imported en masse to Europe. The spice was first definitively mentioned outside of Southern Asia by early Arabic sources. For instance, explorer Ibn Battuta noted that on his travels to Delhi he had seen people take a snake, “slit open its stomach, and stuff it with curcuma (turmeric). This...takes the place of saffron with them. When I saw this small animal and them eating it, I took a loathing at it and would not eat it.”

	data-active="true"></var>

By the late medieval period, the spice was definitely imported to Europe in large quantities; Joan Thirsk describes how by 1428, turmeric was a “now familiar” spice imported to Italy.[^ref6]  The importance of turmeric in 15th and 16th century Europe becomes clear in Siena-born doctor and naturalist Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s 1558 Latin commentary on Dioscorides’ _Materia Medica_, There, he writes, “Experienced physicians identify the other genus of cypress, which resembles ginger and comes from India.” He writes that this type of cypress “work[s] wonders on ulcers,…posses a certain constrictive power which suits them for treating canker sores” and helps to induce “urination or menstruation.” Mattioli further refers to the fact that the root has a “slightly bitter taste, and is yellow like saffron when chewed,” suggesting its use medicinally and gastronomically.

	data-active="true"></var>

 Even as the spice became somewhat common within Europe, in the early modern period  many European sources continued to view some uses of the spice with both curiosity and disgust. For instance, John Pechey, in a 1694 herbal of plants used in “physics and surgery,” wrote from London that turmeric’s color (in spite of its perceived similarity to the Mediterranean plant saffron) emphasizes its strangeness to a European audience, writing “People of China...make an Ointment with this root,” which men and women rubbed on their bodies. Pechey continues, “this may seem very odd [to] those that are unaccustomed to it, by reason of the yellow color.”

	data-url="https://jstor-labs.github.io/plant-humanities/geojson/london.json"
	data-active="true"></var>

By the time Pechey was writing, as Cargo Sheets from the Folger Shakespeare Library demonstrate, turmeric was being imported to Britain in large quantities by the East India Company, and sold at the East India House to grocers and traders. It may be ahistorical to draw a distinction at this time between what was used as cuisine and what was used as medicine. One letter-writer, [in a 1600 epistle to English lawyer and colonizer John Winthrop](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:53409412$1i), even suggests using the "turmerick", along with barbarie bark boiled in beer with saffron, in order to cure yellow jaundice. Others suggest that turmeric is especially useful in terms of bodily obstructions; a [1792 tract on medical botany by William Woodville](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48537187) says that “this root has had the character of being a powerful aperient and resolvent: it has been commonly prescribed in obstruction of the liver, and other chronic visceral affections.” “The disease," Woodville continues, "in which it has been thought most efficacious is the jaundice,” and he notes that the root has been “highly recommended by several practical writers.”

	data-active="true"></var>

Its popularity as a medicinal agent seems to have decreased by the early 19th century. In [Thornton’s 1810 work _A Family Herbal_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/250671#page/7/mode/1up) he notes the fallacious nature of the claim that turmeric could cure jaundice, writing, “from an ignorant suspicion that the jaundice was to be cured by whatever produced a yellow colour, that is, I suspect, seeing the bile diffused into the habit, from obstruction of passage of the gall-duct, these yellow remedies were used to supply its place, just as the yolks of eggs are used in the same complaint.” He continues, writing that, turmeric “posses[es] only slender virtue.” An [1817 medicinal dictionary](https://books.google.com/books?id=uWNZAAAAIAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=A%20New%20Medical%20Dictionary%3A%20Containing%20an%20Explanation%20of%20the%20Terms%20in%20Anatomy&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false) echoes this assessment of turmeric’s change in status, writing that, “it is now very seldom used medicinally” and that the root is mainly used as “an ingredient in the composition of Curry Powder,” as well as a tool for dyeing. From the 1800s on, turmeric was thus chiefly employed in the West as a culinary (as well as a dyeing) agent. What was the significance of this use, and how did it function discursively in the broader age of empire?

### Colonizing the Table 

The British manuscript receipt books held by the [Folger Shakespeare Library](https://www.folger.edu/) demonstrate the ways turmeric was used to domesticate the empire, while simultaneously allowing Britons to participate in the “exotic” nature of empire. That turmeric was used to allow British eaters to orientalize and exoticize the Indian empire becomes clear in discussions of the root’s yellow color. Many recipes for Indian pickles use turmeric primarily not as a pickling agent, but as a coloring agent. For instance, in the (most likely) 18th century recipe for “Indian lile,” -- considered an early precursor to the British dish “piccalilli” -- the author gives a recipe for a “pickle,” instructing the reader to find “1 ounce of fresh capsicum either green or red. Salt it. 3 days & dry it in the sun. Turmeric root powder 1/2 ounce — put all into a stone jar, with a sufficient quantity of best vinegar almost to fill it.” It is interesting that the author does not specify the color of the capsicum, saying either green or red function well. Perhaps this is because the author understands that the turmeric will overpower whatever color is inherent in the capsicum, meaning that either will match a perceived Indian original. Indeed, almost all of the other recipes for turmeric in the Folger’s recipe books refer to the dish’s perceived Indian origins. In this sense, the color of the dish matters because it marks the dish as “Indian.”
<var data-primary="image"></var>
<var data-image id="luna-144664" title="A Recipe for Indian Lile" data-url="https://luna.folger.edu/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size3/FOLGER~3~3/1036/144664.jpg" data-region=""></var>

Other recipes make this use of turmeric as a coloring agent even more explicit. Susanna Kellet's 1780 recipe for “a curry of chickens,” calls for pepper, salt, cayenne, “a small table spoonful of curry powder” and “two small teaspoonfuls of turmerick to colour.” Historian Stephanie Maroney has pointed out that “presumably, there would already be turmeric in the curry powder, so to add two more teaspoons would make the dish very orange and exotic looking.”  As the turmeric is added specifically “to colour,” the dish is “visually mark(ed) as different from ‘traditional’ English food.”[^ref7] Through this recipe, we see how turmeric’s yellow color was explicitly understood as a means through which dishes could be signified as Indian, or at least non-English. Similarly, in a mid-18th century recipe for “Frangas Encapadas,” an Anglicized recipe for Portuguese chicken soup, the author instructs that the rice upon which the soup is served should be “half coloured with turmeric.” In what is perhaps a nod to Portuguese colonization of the “East Indies,” here, it becomes clear how turmeric is used to signal the allegedly “exotic” origin of dishes.

This use of turmeric within the broader pantheon of curry powder spices did more than bring the exotic to Britain — it also worked to, in the words of scholar Susan Zlotnick, “domesticate” the exotic. As Zlotnick notes, Eliza Acton, one of the most influential English cookery authors, wrote in her 1845 work _Modern Cookery_ of curries of allegedly English origin, claiming that, with “plain” English dishes “we have intermingled many others which we know to be excellent of their kind, and which now so far belong to our national cookery, as to be met with commonly at all refined modern tables.” Here, Eliza Acton makes explicit the notion of bringing foreign dishes into the fold of English national cuisine. What is one such allegedly foreign dish that has been domesticated in this manner? Turmeric-laden curry powder, which she gives a recipe for later in the book. And, indeed, the section on “curries’ in the book is combined with a discussion of British “potted meats,” demonstrating how presumed Indian dishes and spices intermingle with British dishes to bring India into the fold of “Greater Britain.” Turmeric thus allows British consumers to appropriate “the exotic” through its unique color,  while still keeping its eaters safely within the fold of the nation.

### Conclusion

As Deborah Lupton writes in her work _Food, the Body, and the Self_, “by taking food into the body, we take in the world.”[^ref8]  The ingestion of turmeric provided one means through which British consumers could take in the larger empire, both exoticizing it for the own benefit while naturalizing it as a British property. This is not to argue that turmeric was solely imported or popularized for ideological reasons— as Marcy Norton has shown, “new tastes emerged out of the social matrix” created by imperialism writ large.[^ref9]  Turmeric, as an important product in South Asian cuisine, was one such foodstuff whose popularity, at least in Europe, most likely increased due to contact with South Asian foodways. And yet, the cultural significance of turmeric, as an exoticized yet domesticated good, demonstrates the ways plants functioned not only as catalysts for imperial expansion, but also as a means through which ideas about the British Empire were diffused.
