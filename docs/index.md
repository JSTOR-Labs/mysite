## The Plant Humanities Initiative
Welcome to the ***Plant Humanities*** visual essays prototype site. This site provides tools for tagging and viewing textual narratives. The tagged narratives enable interactive visualizations that augment the textual content with maps, videos, and hi-resolution images. This site has been developed in support of the [*Plant Humanities Initiative*](https://labs.jstor.org/planthumanities/), a collaboration between [Dumbarton Oaks](https://www.doaks.org/) and [JSTOR Labs](https://labs.jstor.org), generously funded by [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/).

## Visual Essays
The visual essay is a text-based narrative that has been enhanced with visual and interactive elements that provide context and supplemental content for text paragraphs in the essay.  The text is annotated with tags that specify the type of visualization to generate for various sections of text.  The essay is written as plain text with optional formatting provided using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a lightweight markup language.
