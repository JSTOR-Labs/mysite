Welcome to the ***Plant Humanities*** visual essays prototype site. This site provides tools for tagging and viewing textual narratives. The tagged narratives enable interactive visualizations that augment the textual content with maps, videos, and hi-resolution images. This site has been developed in support of the [*Plant Humanities Initiative*](https://labs.jstor.org/planthumanities/), a collaboration between [Dumbarton Oaks](https://www.doaks.org/) and [JSTOR Labs](https://labs.jstor.org), generously funded by [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/).

## Visual Essays
Visual essays are text-based narratives that has been enhanced with visual and interactive elements providing context and supplemental content for text paragraphs in the essay.  The essay text is annotated with tags that specify the type of visualization to generate for various sections of text.  The essay is written as plain text with optional formatting provided using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a lightweight markup language.  A key element in the visual essay concept is the use of  Wikidata and other knowledge bases for data used in the visualizations.  Associated the essay text with entities in Wikidata (and other knowledge bases) enables the visualizations to be generated with minimal tagging by the user.  As an example, it is often desirable to provide a map with marker pins when describing locations.  In the visual essay tool this is easily done by simply adding a tag with the Wikidata entity ID associated with the location(s) to be included on a map visualization.
