# Falling Stands: Climate change, cultivation and culture of Cryptomeria japonica in the 21st Century

Japanese cedar (_Cryptomeria japonica_), sūgi in Japanese, is the national tree of Japan and the most widely planted tree species in the country. It was the backbone of a massive and successful afforestation project following World War II and the Korean War. Today, 40% of Japan is forested, and 60% of this forest is artificial[^1]. The once present affinity that led to the widespread planting of the species has tarnished. Cryptomeria is now known for the massive amounts of pollen that the female trees produce each springtime[^2]. In recent decades, spring in Japan has become synonymous with a drastic public health hazard, as one quarter of the population is commonly afflicted with Japanese cedar pollinosis[^3].

While Cryptomeria’s cultural significance is well documented through history, its current copious planting is a conscious choice that reflects the idea of national symbolism, conservation strategies, economic systems, and changing demographics. The story of Japanese cedar in the twentieth century shows how a single species can culturally, economically, and spiritually shape a national landscape. Today, as aging monocultural stands of sūgi fall, the tree’s symbolic role in the landscape is changing again to adapt to the needs and concerns of the Japanese population.

### All in the Family 

A ubiquitous evergreen conifer planted on all four of Japan’s main islands, Cryptomeria japonica is native to China and Japan. Numerous archeological studies sought to find buried traces of Japanese cedar pollen in hopes of tracing the tree’s habitation patterns. These studies confirmed that the species had existed in small forested areas around 13,000 BCE. Cryptomeria increased its presence on the island significantly following a change in climate that took place from 5,000 BCE to Common Era, when the country’s environment generally became colder and wetter, a climate ideal for cedar trees[^4]. 
Cryptomeria japonica is a dioecious tree and the only species in the genus Cryptomeria. It is part of the Cupressacae family found on all continents, which includes junipers, cypresses, and redwoods[^5].  Its distinctive pyramidical form with tiered branching appears in traditional Japanese paintings of temples and shrine complexes, often creating a visual backdrop to isolate the sacred space from the wilderness. Associated with religious sites, the tree is used as an ornamental species, despite often being planted in large groves or to demarcate boundaries. It has also been revered in its own right. There is a tradition of designating older, larger sūgi trees as sacred objects, ritually wrap them in shimenawa, cloth pieces that demarcate places of spiritual significance. In such locations, sūgi is prized, with each individual specimen receiving high levels of maintenance and stewardship.

### Sūgi in the Historical and Cultural Landscape      

The decision to plant sūgi trees had its roots in the millennia of Japan’s cultural history. The _Nihon Shoki_, the second oldest Japanese historical record that dates from 720 CE, is the earliest written source that mentions this forest species. It refers to Susanoo, a multifaceted deity, who created trees—including Cryptomeria japonica from his hair, noting that it is an excellent material for building ships[^6][^7].

Cryptomeria japonica is depicted in the 1309 painted scrolls Kasuga Gongen Genki. One image shows a single specimen, tall with tufts of needles. It stands alone, neither directly next to the building of the Kasuga Shrine nor in the forest, dominating the foreground. Carefully maintained, this tree still stands in the Nara prefecture, having withstood the building’s reconstructions[^8].

Katsushika Hokusai’s woodblock prints of Mishima Pass in Kai province, from the Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, is dominated by an enormous Cryptomeria japonica trunk. The tree dwarfs the travelers, some of whom are attempting to measure it's size, and visually competes with the wonderment of Mount Fuji. Hokusai started this series when he was seventy in response to the cultural fascination with the mountain as an object of pilgrimage, due to its scenic beauty as well as mythical connection with immortality. Despite the identified location, this print may not be an accurate topographic representation but an attempt to capture the mood and character of the Japanese landscape[^9].

Groves of Cryptomeria japonica were typically associated with temple complexes. At Ryōan-ji , a temple in Kyoto celebrated for its Zen garden and originally constructed in the fifteenth century, these trees can both be seen in their natural form, reaching over 100 feet into the sky, and as daisūgi, a coppicing technique that emerged during the Muromachi period (1336–1573) to create thinner posts for tea room construction[^10].  Built in 1617, Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine, also showcases the grandeur of Japanese cedar trees. Its creation involved the planting of 40,000 specimens of Cryptomeria japonica, most famously along the Avenue of Cedars that led to the shrine. The 10,000 trees that still stand convey the site’s spiritual power, which is not limited to the building but permeates throughout the forested landscape[^11].

During his travels in Japan in the late nineteenth century, Charles Sprague Sargent—an American botanist and the first director of the Arnold Arboretum—documented Cryptomeria japonica as grown both as a timber tree and in temple groves. Noting its use in construction, he also reported the legend behind the Avenue at Nikko. Sargent was told the trees were planted by a poor feudal lord as a tribute to Japan’s military ruler, the shōgun, in 1616. As he wrote, “this avenue, if the story told of its origin is true, can teach a useful lesson, and caries hope to the heart of the planter of trees, who will see in it a monument more lasting than those which men sometimes erect in stone or bronze in the effort to perpetuate the memory of their greatness.”[^12]

### A View from Yakushima Island 

[Princess Mononoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke), the 1997 Japanese fantasy film directed by Hayao Miyazaki and set in the Muromachi period, tells the story of a battle over the survival of the Great Forest Spirit, an animist deity who lives among ancient sūgi trees. For inspiration for the animated landscapes in his film, Miyazaki traveled to Yakushima Island in the south-west of Japan[^15].  The island’s environmental history offers a lens for understanding the complexity of Japan’s forest history and policy. It is home to one of the last remaining primary Cryptomeria forest, which includes the country’s largest conifer tree, Jōmon-Sūgi, estimated to be over 2,170 years old. The tree grows alongside deciduous overstory species, such as oak and chestnut, with an evergreen broadleaf understory including rhododendrons and epiphytes that grow on branches[^16].  

<param ve-image  rotate="90"

This forest composition is most similar to Japan’s prehistoric forests. Until roughly 6,000 years ago most of Japan was covered with broadleaf deciduous species like oaks, with an understory of sedges that endured significant temperature fluctuations across the archipelago. Cryptomeria only became a prominent species across Japan 4,000 years ago, even before the Jōmon period in Japanese prehistory, when falling sea levels across Japan left behind a bed of clay soil that Cryptomeria thrives in[^17].

On Yakushima Island, sūgi were continuously cut down and replanted as plantations by foresters from the mid-seventeenth century. While 4,300 hectares of inland mountainous forest was designated as a research forest in 1922, a network of logging railroads and infrastructure was built to extract more trees during the same time[^18].

The pace of deforestation increased as the Japanese Imperial Army demanded additional timber for ship construction during World War II from 1941-1945 and the Korean War from 1950-1953. Across the Japanese archipelago, from Yakushima to Hokkaido, citizens burned timber as an energy supply during times of shortage. The old deciduous and conifer forests were burned as biomass to generate electricity and fuel cooking fires. As a result, by the mid-twentieth century, the landscape of Japan was radically transformed. It was sparsely forested[^19].  In 1993 Yakushima was added to the World Heritage list for its ongoing geological processes, biological evolution, natural beauty and significant habitat. The interior primary forest is still preserved, and some plantations have been abandoned, while others are still logged to this day.

### Crypto Currency: from Specimen Species to Monoculture Mascot 

Following the World War II period, the Japanese government instigated a series of agrarian reforms that redistributed land from wealthy merchants to smaller tenant farmers[^20]. These reforms incentivized forestry and crop practices that maximized short-term yield on limited space, including monoculture planting. Additionally, in 1964, the Forestry Basic Act was passed, which effectively established a national forest industry in Japan, including plans to build thousands of miles of road across the nation to allow timber to be easily harvested from hilly, densely forested regions and shipped out to ports along the coast[^21].  

<param ve-image 
       label="Historical photograph of forester on Yakushima Island" 
       url="https://github.com/Ejostol/Falling-Stands-/blob/main/IMG_3081-01.JPG?raw=true">

The Act was aimed to build closer ties between urban and rural areas, linking previously separated parts of Japan through educational forestry programs and vocational training. The road network allowed for more than the transport of timber, it enabled the flow of knowledge and forestry practices from the urban centers to the once isolated rural villages. This legislation also included guarantees from the Japanese government that forestry workers would receive subsidies in the event of a natural disaster or falling international markets[^22]. These subsidies, which still exist today, included offsetting the harvest and transportation costs, allowing foresters to take advantage of ports and other international distribution points to sell their timber[^23].

       url="https://github.com/Ejostol/Falling-Stands-/blob/main/DSC_0018.JPG?raw=true">

Following the success of these agrarian and forestry reforms, 4 billion cedar trees were planted across Japan between 1950 and 1970, with this number increasing steadily. 16 million new cedar trees have been planted each year since the 1970s[^24].

In the 1980s, the value of hardwood tree species such as Cryptomeria crashed, as the demand for wood products lessened. Cheaper plastics flooded the market, and other nations, including Portugal, began clearing their forest land to make room for Cryptomeria plantations. This new international competition crippled the Japanese market, built around the afforestation program. The promise of a thriving rural economy based on harvesting forest products and efficiently distributing them from urban centers died over the course of a single decade. It also left millions of acres of planted forests with little economic value. Furthermore, after an earthquake devastated large areas of Japan in 1995, the government created strict regulations around the types of timber suitable for domestic construction. Japanese cedar no longer met the new regulations, decreasing domestic demand for the tree[^25].

### Cryptomeria grows into the 21st Century  

Today, Japan is the most densely forested developed nation in the world as a result of the afforestation policy in the late twentieth century[^26].  The massive swathes of the monoculture plantations across the country, however, are aging. Many have been abandoned due to high management costs and low profits from Cryptomeria forests, despite government subsidies. The increase of unattended and aging stands presents new concerns. 

<param ve-image fit="contain"

The monoculture planting has changed every layer of the Japanese forest. The regimented distribution of trees at regular intervals destroys layers of understory vegetation that provides habitats for a variety of flora and fauna. On managed plots, foresters remove woody debris, leaving tightly packed vertical trunks. This careful spacing means that most plantations have more living biomass that sequesters carbon. As plantations are abandoned, branches and trunks rot on the forest floor, releasing carbon that is taken up by fungi.[^27] Over time, such plantations may become carbon emitters instead of carbon sinks. Scientists have studied these thinning practices to determine the optimal ways to maintain beneficial microfungi and introduce a spontaneous understory that colonizes under the plantation branches.[^28]

Cryptomeria plantations also pose a significant risk for avalanches and soil slides. The trees have horizontal, shallow roots, and are therefore in danger of falling and stripping away anything else in their path. Such risks are particularly high during heavy rainfall or typhoons, which are common across the archipelago and are projected to increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change.[^29]

Transitioning to more diverse forestry species and practices is a lengthy process. In order for the eighty species of deciduous hardwood trees that grow in Japan to take root on plantations that have been planted in conifer monocultures, the seeds must blow in and have adequate sunlight and light to become established. Areas that have been completely clearer for Cryptomeria plantations over longer periods of time particularly resist diversification, as there are no local sources of seeds.[^30] Even on abandoned plantation sites, regenerating cedars compete with spontaneously growing species, making it difficult for new woody plants to establish.[^31] As a result, in order to increase the number of forest species, the entire landscape of Japan, not just the individual plantations, need to be managed and diversified.   

<param ve-image

       license="public domain" 
       url="https://github.com/Ejostol/Falling-Stands-/blob/main/DSC_0117.JPG?raw=true">

Areas where Cryptomeria trees are growing will likely remain planted with conifers for hundreds of years, while areas where they have been cut down will see new species emerge on the forest floor and create new types of plant communities. This type of mixed forest is likely to take over large areas of current Japanese cedar plantations as they are abandoned. Once again, the species composition of Japan will be transformed as the Japanese landscape is reshaped by forestry. This new type of forest will require new management practices and a different approaches, learning from connections within diverse ecosystems instead of merely dealing with plantations and spontaneously growing forest.

### Pollen Nation  

Cryptomeria trees are still planted around Japan. Yet, the risk of pollinosis—a reaction to the pollen released every spring as Cryptomerias begin to breed—has changed the composition of Japanese plantations. Female trees release up to 5 pounds of pollen each spring and rely on pollinators and the wind to spread their seed. Across the country, 33 million people are affected by pollinosis in what became the nation’s largest public health crisis each year. Japan’s health and forestry agencies have developed a comprehensive public health campaign to limit exposure. Monitors throughout major cities and the countryside count the amount of pollen in the air, and warnings to wear masks and avoid going outside are issued in urban areas by government agencies, universities, and public health clinics working together. In urban areas such as Tokyo, where tree plantations exist directly outside the city, containing pollinosis is challenging. High rooftops close to Cryptomeria canopies collect pollen, and tires whizzing along the highway resuspend pollen after it falls to the ground.[^32]

<param ve-image
       label="A map showing the progression of the pollen season throughout Japan in 2017. Peak season is in the middle of March, but the season can last up to three months in some areas"

       url="https://github.com/Ejostol/Falling-Stands-/blob/main/Map%20of%20Regions_wind%20with%20colors-01.png?raw=true">

The Japanese government has worked to genetically alter the species, which would allow the rural forestry industry to continue in an era of increasing urbanization in Japan. It started a campaign to produce pollen without the allergens _Cry j1_ and _Cry j 2_, which create symptoms of pollinosis. Research agencies across the archipelago breed these hypo-allergenic trees to introduce them to plantations. Since 2007, 130 different pollen-free varieties have been produced. The cost of these trees makes them a challenge to plant as an alternative to the non-modified Cryptomeria trees. A program of subsidies from the Japanese government, however, attempts to lessen the burden on foresters.[^33]

### Taking a Stand 

The Cryptomeria afforestation project shows the dangers of treating rural forest areas as an economic resource dependent on international networks and extracted without thinking through the consequences of this industry for people and the environment. The policies of the Forestry and Forest Basic Act of 1964 enabled the landscape that in the twenty-first century creates an annually public health crisis on a national scale. This problem reveals how interconnected urban and rural areas are, and how trees growing hundreds of miles from urban centers dramatically affect the lives of millions of city inhabitants. These issues are likely to continue until the forests are restored to a new kind of ecological balance, as other species return to Cryptomeria. The story of Cryptomeria suggests that falling stands can give rise to many models of regeneration and adaptation.
