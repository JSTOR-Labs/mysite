Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the natural world. These plants developed extraordinary leaf adaptations that help to diversify their diet and, in turn, compensate for the nutrient-poor soil found in their native habitats, in Southeast Asia and Oceania.[^ref1] _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, portrayed in this print, evolved wing-shaped petioles capable of absorbing sunlight to fuel the synthesis of glucose (photosynthesis) and highly modified pitcher-like leaves capable of deriving nutrients from prey and animal feces. More remarkable still, _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows not one but two types of pitchers: first lower and then upper ones. While squat low-lying pitchers catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, tapered aerial ones seize flying insects and collect bat guano. Curious and beautiful, _Nepenthes rafflesiana_’s pitchers also captured the interest of humans, shaping their interactions with this plant in life and through the medium of art.[^ref2]

Many rich and complex cultural engagements with nepenthes explored the botanical significance of their pitchers, while expressing an enduring fascination with their form and function. Indeed, the first known published description of a nepenthes was authored by Étienne de Flacourt, a French colonial governor of Madagascar, for his book [_Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar_,](https://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.do?id=406802) from 1658.[^ref3] Astonished by the pitcher of a plant now named _Nepenthes madagascariensis_, Flacourt extolled this “small vase, with its own lid,” that he mistook for a “flower or fruit,” as a truly “wonderful sight.”[^ref4] He could never have imagined that this fantastical botanical form was a leaf, nor dreamed of its function as a pitfall trap.

In the 1600s and 1700s,  European enchantment with nepenthes grew through direct encounters with live plants within their native ranges and the crucible of colonialism. By the 1840s and 1850s, however, these human-plant interactions were no longer mostly confined to the geographies of Southeast Asia and Oceania. Instead, colonial trade networks enabled many European city dwellers to “discover” nepenthes without ever having to travel. Not surprisingly, encountering the plant at world’s fairs and public green spaces and in the pages of illustrated horticultural journals whetted appetites for more. So insatiable were they that nepenthes became an extraordinarily popular domestic plant in the 1870s. A cultural history of _Nepenthes_ and _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ focused on Ghent- and Paris-based horticultural and artistic networks explores the significance of their efforts to recast pitcher plants as exotic curiosities. It also considers how these imperial, commercial, and artistic enterprises transformed cultural perceptions of tropical carnivores and how changing human-plant relations in the nineteenth century impacted current efforts to conserve endangered species.

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.

Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.

### Environmental Impact of Floriculture

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.
