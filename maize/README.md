The year was 2014, and many Guatemalans were incensed. In a country with a population of 14 million, approximately 120,000 took to the streets. Protesters blocked traffic along the Pan American Highway and other major roadways to voice their opposition to the “Law for the Protection of New Plant Varieties, or, as it was popularly known, the “Monsanto Law." The law “outlawed the replanting, transportation, or selling of privatized seeds without permission, and made these actions punishable by one to four years in jail and a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 quetzals (130 to 1,300 US dollars)."

The Guatemalan public foresaw several problems with this protection for privatized seeds, or genetically modified seeds subject to a patent or copyright. The law sought to regulate the use of specific maize seeds, engineered by Monsanto to withstand Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide. By outlawing the replanting of these seeds, the law increased farmer dependence on big agribusiness. In response, opposition to the law swelled, bringing together a motley crew of protestors, including "peasant federations, health workers, biologists, Maya spiritual leaders, environmentalists, Pentecostals who regard Monsanto as an anti-Christ, opportunistic politicians, college students, and even Guatemala City foodies."

Why did maize inspire such strong reactions? Since its initial domestication over 9000 years ago, Mesoamerican communities have lived in symbiosis with maize: humans in the region, through their own ingenuity and acumen, domesticated the crop which provided them with necessary sustenance. In turn, communities in Mesoamerica constructed their societies, cosmologies, and cultures around the plant. The Monsanto Law effectively attempted to dissolve this sacred interdependence and reciprocity between local communities and maize. The history of maize thus demonstrates the complexities of human relationships to plants, which resist categorization solely as units to be bought, sold, or patented under capitalism.

### A Kernel of Science
What is maize, and how did it develop? This question may seem simple, particularly given the ubiquity of corn-based products, but the large body of scholarship on the crop reveals it to be anything but straightforward. Maize, or in taxonomic parlance _Zea mays L._, is a cereal grain consisting of a stalk, tassels of pollen, and ears filled with cobs of kernels (averaging 800 kernels spread across 16 rows).
