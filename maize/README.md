The year was 2014, and many Guatemalans were incensed. In a country with a population of 14 million, approximately 120,000 took to the streets. Protesters blocked traffic along the Pan American Highway and other major roadways to voice their opposition to the “Law for the Protection of New Plant Varieties, or, as it was popularly known, the “Monsanto Law." The law “outlawed the replanting, transportation, or selling of privatized seeds without permission, and made these actions punishable by one to four years in jail and a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 quetzals (130 to 1,300 US dollars)."

The Guatemalan public foresaw several problems with this protection for privatized seeds, or genetically modified seeds subject to a patent or copyright. The law sought to regulate the use of specific maize seeds, engineered by Monsanto to withstand Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide. By outlawing the replanting of these seeds, the law increased farmer dependence on big agribusiness. In response, opposition to the law swelled, bringing together a motley crew of protestors, including "peasant federations, health workers, biologists, Maya spiritual leaders, environmentalists, Pentecostals who regard Monsanto as an anti-Christ, opportunistic politicians, college students, and even Guatemala City foodies."

Why did maize inspire such strong reactions? Since its initial domestication over 9000 years ago, Mesoamerican communities have lived in symbiosis with maize: humans in the region, through their own ingenuity and acumen, domesticated the crop which provided them with necessary sustenance. In turn, communities in Mesoamerica constructed their societies, cosmologies, and cultures around the plant. The Monsanto Law effectively attempted to dissolve this sacred interdependence and reciprocity between local communities and maize. The history of maize thus demonstrates the complexities of human relationships to plants, which resist categorization solely as units to be bought, sold, or patented under capitalism.

### A Kernel of Science
What is maize, and how did it develop? This question may seem simple, particularly given the ubiquity of corn-based products, but the large body of scholarship on the crop reveals it to be anything but straightforward. Maize, or in taxonomic parlance _Zea mays L._, is a cereal grain consisting of a stalk, tassels of pollen, and ears filled with cobs of kernels (averaging 800 kernels spread across 16 rows).

The reliance of many human societies on maize, the “[most dominant and productive crop](https://futureoffood.org/insights/the-global-importance-of-maize-diversity/#:~:text=As%20the%20world's%20most%20dominant,%2C%20sweeteners%2C%20starch%2C%20and%20for),” for their survival is well known. What is less obvious is the plant’s reliance on humans for its survival. Maize most likely was domesticated from teosinte, a grass with tassels and several small clustered ears.  However, there are clear differences between modern-day maize and teosinte: the latter is made up of 6-12 kernels held in two rows surrounded by a protective shell, whereas maize proffers a cob with approximately 20 rows of kernels without a hard outer shell.  These differences are so profound that, as one article in [_PNAS_](https://www.pnas.org/) notes, “19th-century botanists failed to recognize the close relationship between these plants, placing teosinte in its own genus, _Euchlaena_." However, , present-day scholars have shown how maize was domesticated from teosinte through humans selecting for a larger ear size and more kernels.

Indigenous groups in what is now Southwestern Mexico played a major role in this domestication process and subsequent plant transfer. Recent phylogenetic analysis has shown that maize most likely arose from a single domestication event, which probably occurred in the Rio Balsas (Balsas River) Valley around 9000 years ago. Agrobiodiversity researchers have noted that “much of the evolution of maize during domestication may have been gradual, and there is evidence of increases in cob size over the first 2000 years of selection. There was an incredible diversity in terms of types of maize after its initial domestication: as scholars have noted, “maize is a sensitive mirror of the people who grow it,” and different Indigenous groups domesticated and cultivated various types of maize depending on “environmental and also [on] social and cultural factors," suggesting the role communities played in developing different types of maize most suited to their needs.

By 7000 years BP, humans had dispersed maize from the Rio Balsas region into South America as a partial domesticate, though, as scholars have noted, there were "multiple waves of dispersal" of maize into South America. There, the crop underwent “secondary improvement in the southwestern Amazon before diversifying across the continent. Humans then dispersed this domesticated vareity back into Central America and to the north, demonstrating the "clear evidence of two-way movements of plants and people lasting millennia between Central and South America." Maize is therefore a notable example of the mobility of plants in relation to humans.

In addition domesticating maize by selecting for attractive characteristics such as cob size, and dispersing it throughout South America and back towards Central America, humans worked to cultivate maize, which could not have survived if left to its own devices. Wild teosinte is very fragile, and its pod can be shattered by the wind. By contrast, maize relies on humans to disperse its seeds.  The scientific history of maize thus reveals the central and active role early Mesoamericans played in its domestication through conscious decisions in the cultivation processes.

### Maize, Milpa, and Mesoamerica
After its domestication, maize quickly became an important crop for Mesoamerican people, both nutritionally and culturally. Modern-day scholars and food policy experts have noted that maize is one of the most productive crops in terms of calories per acre.  This nutritional importance extends back into the pre-colonial era. Historically, Maya peoples practiced milpa agriculture, an agroecosystem which relied on extensive intercropping (and is [being extolled](https://www.cimmyt.org/news/classic-milpa-maize-intercrop-can-help-feed-communities-forgotten-by-development/) as a means to promote biodiversity and address food insecurity today). Under this system, maize was intercropped with plants including beans, squash, peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes, allowing for greater soil and landscape regeneration when compared to monocrops.  This practice, was incredibly productive: scientists have shown that in a milpa "the maize stalk supports the climbing bean, increasing the latter’s access to light, while the bean plant fixes additional nitrogen in the soil."  Maize thus not only represented an important source of nutrition in and of itself, but also enabled the growth of other nutritionally significant crops. Archeologists, using carbon isotope analysis of human bones and teeth, have shown how "maize was an important dietary component throughout life" for populations throughout the Maya area.

In order to obtain the utmost nutrients from maize, people in Mesoamerica practice a process called nixtamalization, a word derived from the Nahuatl terms for lime and maize dough. While, as scholars have noted, the "origin and development [of the nixtamalization process] remain archeologically unclear," the lime treatment of maize has been used for at least the past 3000 years in Mesoamerica to produce a "reduction of the labor required to grind maize, by breaking down the kernel's durable external pericarp or shell; and enhanced nutrition, by releasing niacin and amino acids inherent in the maize and contributing additional calcium from the lime.”  While nixtamalization does reduce the effort of grinding maize, this process was still very labor intensive for Mesoamerican women, who traditionally grind maize kernels into masa, or dough, over a metate or grinding stone. Further, maize is not only used to produce masa; Mesoamerican peoples make use of the maize stalks to produce maize beer, referred to as tesqüino in certain parts of Mesoamerica and chicha (Q51592) in others.

The nutritional importance of maize cannot be separated from its cultural significance. In the Popol Vuh (Q220264), which recounts the Maya creation story, humans were quite literally molded by the deities out of maize.  Scholars have long recognized motifs of maize found in Olmec and Maya iconography.  However, in the past four decades, scholars have begun to identify a specific “Maize God”. This god has an “elongated, tonsured head [which] mimics the long tasseled cob,” and often has “maize grain ... infixed into his head,” among other qualities. While there is much about the Maize God that remains to be explained in the scholarly literature, it is clear “that the corn cycle was the central metaphor of life and death for the Maya and the nucleus around which much of their religiosity was formed.”

For the Maya, maize was and is more than simply a metaphor and a powerful image in the Mesoamerican visual lexicon. Seventeenth-century records demonstrate how in highland Guatemala, upon the birth of a son, the Maya community would burn the blood of the umbilical cord. Then, they would “pas[s] an ear of maize through the smoke,” which would subsequently be planted in the maize field. Ethnographers have recorded that “parents used the maize from this small patch of land to feed the child ‘until he reached the age when he could plant for himself, saying that thus he not only ate by the sweat of his brow, but of his own blood as well.’”  Further, in certain regions, mothers “place an ear of maize into the palm of their newborns, and eat only dishes made from maize while breast-feeding to ensure that the child grows ‘true flesh.’”  Maize, for Maya people, thus represents more than both calories or symbol: it is a sacred plant from which all life grows.

 ### Maize in the Colonial and Postcolonial Eras
 During the colonial era, Maya understandings of maize as a sacred plant pushed up against European understandings of the crop. Spanish colonizers often publicly denigrated foods like maize as “dangerous to the European constitution.”  But even as the Spanish publicly disdained maize, there is ample evidence that they recognized the utility—and scrumptiousness— of the crop: one Peruvian annalist of the era recounted how one group of conquistadors inhaled maize “as if it were sugared almonds.”  Indeed, there are records of conquistadors enjoying atole, a maize beverage, and eating puddings made of maize.

While early conquistadors disparaged maize, from the nineteenth century onwards, the crop began to attract the attention of scientists from Europe and the United States due to its productivity and economic potential both as a domestic and export crop. In the early twentieth century, scientists from the US and Europe traveled to regions in Mexico, Peru, and Guatemala, among others to identify unique “landraces,” (Q174030)  or locally adapted domesticates, of maize.  Historian of science Helen Curry has detailed how scientists attempted to transpose putative human race science onto maize taxonomies: “At the most fundamental level, the raw material and motivation for classification arose directly from the imperative of ‘improvement’ in both crops and people.”  These scientists presented a vision of “early, stable indigenous races, transformed by racial mixing with newly arriving populations from other geographical regions, giving rise to valuable new ‘incipient’ but still-unstable racial types.”

Bolstered in part by this racialized understanding of maize, scientists around the world began to breed maize for preferred traits, namely, quick growth and high productivity. By the 1940s, the Rockefeller Foundation (Q862034) began to partner with the Mexican government to increase production rates of certain staple crops, including maize.  These attempts to turn maize into a scientific commodity attracted both local and global concern: one American geographer noted that this endeavor proffered the potential “disastrous destruction of local genes.... Mexican agriculture cannot be pointed toward standardization on a few commercial types without upsetting native economy and culture hopelessly.”  As one Mexican scientist detailed, some communities refused to sell types of maize used in rituals, no matter what price was offered.

These examples illuminate the resistance of communities in Central and South America to the commodification of maize. Maize even became a symbol of Central American cultural and political independence. In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan prohibited trade with Nicaragua in an attempt to erode the power of the Sandinistas, a left-wing political group. What this meant in practical terms was that Nicaragua was unable to obtain a sufficient supply of wheat, usually imported from the United States. In response, Nicaraguan artist Luis Enrique Mejía Godoy released a song titled "Somos Hijos Del Maiz," or, "We Are the Children of Corn," to rally support for the Sandinistas and resist American political influence. The song begins with the lyrics (in translation) "If they take away our bread/We will see ourselves in the obligation/ to survive as our grandparents did/ with fermented corn / in the blood of the heroes." Here, the sanctity of maize became a way to express independence from colonial and neo-colonial powers.

Maize's cultural, political, and economic significance persists in Central American communities today. Milpa agriculture continues to be practiced by Maya farmers and has been hailed as “[central](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2017/10/a-mexican-legacy-la-milpa-the-birthplace-of-maize/#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20the%20milpa,an%20amazing%20variety%20of%20peppers.)” in the preservation of the biodiversity of Mexico. However, this is not to say that the symbiotic relationship between Indigenous communities and the plant has remained unchanged— anthropologists have noted the effects of globalization and migration patterns. As one woman named Teresa living in San Miguel del Valle, Oaxaca puts it: "No, we didn't have to go looking for maize [like we do now]...That’s how we lived, that’s how it was before. Now it is different. Why? Because we live in the town... and we no longer have everything that we produced naturally, not anymore. What we eat now comes from elsewhere."  Beverages like atole, which used to be produced domestically, have been industrialized, and are now sold by multinational companies.
