The year was 2014, and many Guatemalans were incensed. In a country with a population of 14 million, approximately 120,000 took to the streets. Protesters blocked traffic along the Pan American Highway and other major roadways to voice their opposition to the “Law for the Protection of New Plant Varieties, or, as it was popularly known, the “Monsanto Law." The law “outlawed the replanting, transportation, or selling of privatized seeds without permission, and made these actions punishable by one to four years in jail and a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 quetzals (130 to 1,300 US dollars)."

The Guatemalan public foresaw several problems with this protection for privatized seeds, or genetically modified seeds subject to a patent or copyright. The law sought to regulate the use of specific maize seeds, engineered by Monsanto to withstand Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide. By outlawing the replanting of these seeds, the law increased farmer dependence on big agribusiness. In response, opposition to the law swelled, bringing together a motley crew of protestors, including "peasant federations, health workers, biologists, Maya spiritual leaders, environmentalists, Pentecostals who regard Monsanto as an anti-Christ, opportunistic politicians, college students, and even Guatemala City foodies."

Why did maize inspire such strong reactions? Since its initial domestication over 9000 years ago, Mesoamerican communities have lived in symbiosis with maize: humans in the region, through their own ingenuity and acumen, domesticated the crop which provided them with necessary sustenance. In turn, communities in Mesoamerica constructed their societies, cosmologies, and cultures around the plant. The Monsanto Law effectively attempted to dissolve this sacred interdependence and reciprocity between local communities and maize. The history of maize thus demonstrates the complexities of human relationships to plants, which resist categorization solely as units to be bought, sold, or patented under capitalism.

### A Kernel of Science
What is maize, and how did it develop? This question may seem simple, particularly given the ubiquity of corn-based products, but the large body of scholarship on the crop reveals it to be anything but straightforward. Maize, or in taxonomic parlance _Zea mays L._, is a cereal grain consisting of a stalk, tassels of pollen, and ears filled with cobs of kernels (averaging 800 kernels spread across 16 rows).

The reliance of many human societies on maize, the “[most dominant and productive crop](https://futureoffood.org/insights/the-global-importance-of-maize-diversity/#:~:text=As%20the%20world's%20most%20dominant,%2C%20sweeteners%2C%20starch%2C%20and%20for),” for their survival is well known. What is less obvious is the plant’s reliance on humans for its survival. Maize most likely was domesticated from teosinte, a grass with tassels and several small clustered ears.  However, there are clear differences between modern-day maize and teosinte: the latter is made up of 6-12 kernels held in two rows surrounded by a protective shell, whereas maize proffers a cob with approximately 20 rows of kernels without a hard outer shell.  These differences are so profound that, as one article in [_PNAS_](https://www.pnas.org/) notes, “19th-century botanists failed to recognize the close relationship between these plants, placing teosinte in its own genus, _Euchlaena_." However, , present-day scholars have shown how maize was domesticated from teosinte through humans selecting for a larger ear size and more kernels.

Indigenous groups in what is now Southwestern Mexico played a major role in this domestication process and subsequent plant transfer. Recent phylogenetic analysis has shown that maize most likely arose from a single domestication event, which probably occurred in the Rio Balsas (Balsas River) Valley around 9000 years ago. Agrobiodiversity researchers have noted that “much of the evolution of maize during domestication may have been gradual, and there is evidence of increases in cob size over the first 2000 years of selection. There was an incredible diversity in terms of types of maize after its initial domestication: as scholars have noted, “maize is a sensitive mirror of the people who grow it,” and different Indigenous groups domesticated and cultivated various types of maize depending on “environmental and also [on] social and cultural factors," suggesting the role communities played in developing different types of maize most suited to their needs.

By 7000 years BP, humans had dispersed maize from the Rio Balsas region into South America as a partial domesticate, though, as scholars have noted, there were "multiple waves of dispersal" of maize into South America. There, the crop underwent “secondary improvement in the southwestern Amazon before diversifying across the continent. Humans then dispersed this domesticated vareity back into Central America and to the north, demonstrating the "clear evidence of two-way movements of plants and people lasting millennia between Central and South America." Maize is therefore a notable example of the mobility of plants in relation to humans.

In addition domesticating maize by selecting for attractive characteristics such as cob size, and dispersing it throughout South America and back towards Central America, humans worked to cultivate maize, which could not have survived if left to its own devices. Wild teosinte is very fragile, and its pod can be shattered by the wind. By contrast, maize relies on humans to disperse its seeds.  The scientific history of maize thus reveals the central and active role early Mesoamericans played in its domestication through conscious decisions in the cultivation processes.
