## Introduction: A Desensitizing Sensory Experience
As the tongue goes numb and all efforts fail to remove the scarlet, sticky substance that binds to one’s teeth like quick-setting epoxy, one starts to panic and wonder if the Dragon’s Blood they just ingested is truly as noxious as its name suggests. Though the epithet “Dragon’s Blood” brings forth images of medieval myths and fantastical notions of fire-breathing lizards soaring high in the sky, this “blood” is in fact the resin of a very real tree. Dracaena draco, the centenary tree with a thick trunk and a distinctive, umbrella-style crown, captured the imaginations of great minds across the ages, from Antiquity’s Pliny the Elder (d. 79 AD)  to the Enlightenment’s Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) . Unlike Pliny, however, Humboldt was not the lone scholar of his age enthralled by the epic allure of the dragon tree, as other European naturalists like André Pierre Ledru (1761-1825) also flocked to D. draco’s native Canary Islands to study it around the turn of the nineteenth century. Soon after their initial encounters with Dragon’s Blood, they all may have realized that this strange sap occupied a liminal space between myth, legend, and scientific botany.

## Sanguine Myths and Elemental Reality

Members of today’s Dracaena genus have long been valued for their signature red resin, Dragon’s Blood, that oozes from cuts in the bark of those trees.[^1]  The first known reports of Dragon’s Blood were dispersed through Pliny’s _Naturalis Historia_, where he recounted the Indian tale of a dragon (representing Brahma) biting a giant elephant (representing Shiva) and their blood mixing into the iconic resin. While this Vedic myth actually originates from Socotra island of Yemen and is based on the resin of Dracaena cinnabari, the fascination with Dragon’s Blood also took a foothold in Europe through the infamous tale of Hercules.

As the eleventh labor of his famous twelve, Hercules was sent to steal the golden apples guarded by Ladon, a vicious dragon with one hundred heads. Once slain by the demigod, Ladon’s blood seeped into the ground and “from it sprung up the trees that we now know as ‘dragon trees,’” and his body was sent to live among the stars.[^2] As Dragon’s Blood soon became one of the most coveted commodities in ancient Greece, so too did it serve as a lasting link between myth and reality, as Greeks from Athens to Thebes believed that, “the dragon trees […] continue[d] to bleed the death of Ladon with a reddish oozing sap whenever they [got] cut.”[^3]

Native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and recently found growing natively on the West coast of Morocco, D. draco is somewhat ubiquitous along the Northwestern coast of Africa. Evidently, the tree and its resin were an important feature of the economy and magico-medicine of the Canary Islands even before colonial contact. Thus, when French explorer Jean de Béthencourt became the first European to write of D. draco in 1402, he recounted an elaborate trade of fishing hooks, knives, and iron in exchange for figs and Dragon’s Blood between his crew and 500 Guanches, the indigenous population of the Canary Islands.[^4]

The Guanches used Dragon’s Blood for a variety of purposes ranging from embalming their dead, to making dyes and varnishes, to even using it as a toothpaste.[^5]  Believing that, when dragons died, they transformed into the divine trees, Guanches would regularly meet under the Orotava giant dragon tree’s large canopy to enact laws and perform judicial duties, as well as base meteorological predictions on the tree’s bloom.[^6]  Dragon’s Blood was, therefore, immensely valuable, as Béthencourt noted that the resin was, “well worth two hundred ducats, while what was given in exchange was hardly worth two francs.”[^7]  Several centuries later, scientific expeditions by naturalists Alexander von Humboldt and André Pierre Ledru would bring popular attention back to the islands and D. draco, as each traveler marveled at this very same tree in Orotava, – a tree impossibly large and old, and still echoing with mystical resonances.

## Dragon’s Blood: from Herbals to Enlightenment Science

After decades of violent attacks against the Guanches, resulting in their extermination, Spanish conquistadors finally vanquished the last of the Canary Islands in 1496. A natural stopping point for travelers to the New World as well as Africa, the Atlantic islands (Comprised of the Canary Islands, as well as the Portuguese Azores and Madeira) welcomed Europeans of all stripes from the sixteenth century onwards. It was during this period of integration of the Canaries into the burgeoning European sphere of influence, then, that D. draco emerged on the stage of European gardens.

Throughout its dissemination into European spaces from the Age of Discovery, Dragon’s Blood was understood chiefly as a medicament. Soon after its introduction, the sticky scarlet resin became nothing short of a panacea panacea with widespread potential to prevent a host of illnesses.[^8]  As a result, the so-called “draco arbor” features in famous early modern herbals, such as John Gerard’s The Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes (1633) and John Parkinson’s Theatrum Botanicum (1640). Both authors pointed to the Atlantic islands as the tree’s most common habitat; as for D. draco’s medical uses, Gerard and Parkinson also agreed —its resin was believed to have effective astringent properties to treat gonorrhea, dysentery, spitting blood, and loose teeth. Gerard noted that “smiths also use it to varnish over their works,” while Parkinson doubted “painters can bring it to be a fit color to be used in their works.”[^9]

European interest in D. draco again resurfaced in the late eighteenth century with the voyages of scientific discovery. German scientist and writer Alexander von Humboldt was the most famous of them all during this period to fall prey to the tree’s enchanting appeal. In Cosmos (1842), his last work, he still recalled the time when, as a child, he “first saw a colossal dragon tree in an old tower of the Botanical Garden in Berlin.[^10]”  The experience was so overwhelming that Humboldt even thought of it as “the source from whence sprang my early and fixed desire to visit the lands of the tropics.”[^11]  A stroll through the botanical garden in his hometown, a virtual travel indeed, prompted Humbold’s desire for actual travel. The fact that the dragon tree bookended Humboldt’s illustrious career, as both a formative experience of his youth and a notable point in his last great work highlights how the dragon tree itself was at the core of his understanding of nature as one interconnected whole.

In 1799, as he stopped in Tenerife before his voyage to the Americas that would make him world-famous, Humboldt found himself in the village of Orotava. There, he entered the garden of a Monsieur Franchy and was immediately awe-struck by the sheer size and magnitude of the dragon tree there – the very same tree that the Guanches had worshipped for centuries. He reported it to measure 60 feet tall and 45 feet in circumference near the roots. “We were told that the trunk of this tree,” Humboldt wrote in his Personal Narrative, “which is mentioned in several ancient documents as marking the boundaries of a field, was as gigantic in the fifteenth century as it is at the present time.” According to his calculations, the specimen was undoubtedly “one of the oldest inhabitants in our world,” which called for special protection.[^12]  Those who mistreated such “monuments of nature,” he pondered, should be punished, especially “in countries destitute of monuments of art” like those he visited in the tropics.[^13]  Humboldt’s experience with the large D. draco at Orotava was far more than the mere realization of a boyish dream, but was instead a pioneering act that that inspired other European travelers to follow in his footsteps and help strengthen a global network of scientific and economic exchanges focused on plants.

## Smothering the Dragon’s Flame: D. draco and the Anthropocene

Humboldt was not the only naturalist of his time attracted to the remarkable centenary dragon tree, as some three years before, in 1796, French naturalist André Pierre Ledru also found himself in M. Franchy’s garden, admiring the very same tree. Even if its scarlet-colored resin was a critical aspect of the Guanche pharmacopoeia and a valuable piece of naturalia that spurred the Canarian economy, the population of trees from which it was sourced was already in decline by the turn of the nineteenth century due to unsustainable cultivation techniques. 
<param ve-image url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/master/images/IMG_2561.jpg">

As Ledru remarked in his 1810 _Voyages aux îles de Ténériffe, la Trinité, Saint-Thomas, Sainte-Croix et Porto-Ricco_, which drew on observations he made during his trip to the Isles of Fortune some fourteen years earlier: “In days gone by, the resin that one extracts from the dragon tree was an important object of commerce for Teneriffe; but since the locals have neglected to replace the old trees that were worn out by too-frequent tapping (of the resin) with young plantations, this source will soon be exhausted. There exist perhaps less than fifty dragon trees left on the island.”[^14]  This gradual, yet persistent, degradation of the D. draco population was not solely due to Guanche overcultivation, either, as Spanish colonizers inflicted profound ecological changes upon the islands when they razed and destroyed large swaths of forests during their conquest and settlement of the Canaries three centuries earlier.[^15] 
<param title="Isles of Fortune" eid="Q19211357"> 
<param ve-image url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/master/images/IMG_9319.jpg">

But even in the face of this acute anthropogenic pressure, the great dragon tree at Orotava persisted. Struck by the tree’s size, age, and enduring spirit, Ledru remarks on how even the most environmentally malicious conquistadors respected this centenary dragon tree.  Perhaps, then, to Humboldt’s delight, Ledru estimated that this special tree would easily live another one-hundred-fifty to two-hundred years.[^16]  

Unfortunately, the centenary dragon tree did not outlive Humboldt and Ledru’s visits by too long. In 1819, a storm first cut off one of its branches, and in 1867, a hurricane-like tempest broke them all off.[^17]  Despite this inauspicious demise, the tree’s image remains associated with the Canary Islands through today, and it is still frequently featured prominently in images of Orotava. Furthermore, both naturalists’ accounts of their encounters with the dragon tree in its native environment stand as proof of its power to equally excite scientific and aesthetic imagination, promote environmental concerns, and reinforce colonial dynamics. 
<param ve-image url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Orotava_Ayuntamiento_04.jpg">

Just as Humboldt and Ledru observed the centenary D. draco at Orotava and pondered the tree’s age, durability, and its potential influence on theories of a global climate, today’s scientists are weighing the tree’s possible medicinal benefits (including potential cancer treatments) and its commercial value in the cosmetics industry as an ingredient in anti-aging creams in relation to the species’ ongoing battle with extinction and its ecological vulnerability.[^18] Since many different species make good sources of what is commonly known as dragon’s blood, more comprehensive research still needs to be carried out to fully assess the mythical resin’s true medicinal efficacy.[^19]

Today, D. draco is officially designated as a vulnerable population on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species due to its near-extinction in the wild.[^20]  As Ledru noted over two centuries ago, this population decline and endangerment is primarily due to overcultivation of the tree’s valuable resin. The number of wild specimens has never been lower, prompting one to wonder if ever again a D. draco will grow to the size and magnificence of the one that so captivated the minds of early moderns like Humboldt and Ledru.[^21]  Perhaps, after its millennia-long smolder, the dragon’s flame will finally be snuffed out by the twenty-first century Anthropocene.

[^1]: Though the focus of this article is on D. draco, there are many other species of tree that exude their own forms of dragon’s blood. These include the other 120 members of the Dracaena genus, in addition to several others. While these other trees certainly exude a resin identified as dragon’s blood, D. draco and Dracaena cinnabari are the two species the most-commonly referenced as the source of the resin in historical sources.
