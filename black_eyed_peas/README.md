### A Food Source and So Much More
While the <span eid="Q498940">black-eyed pea</span> or cowpea has a global history stretching back millennia, its social and cultural significance has changed over time. From a staple crop in Africa, revered by some peoples there as a symbol of luck and fertility worthy of offering to the deities, the black-eyed pea within Europe was understood as a humble food for laborers. In the Americas, too, the bean was a marker of class and culture, the crop an important food source for enslaved peoples. Modern-day cuisine the world over still embraces the cowpea as a food rich in culture and history as well as delicious source of innovative dishes that celebrate new traditions. The black-eyed pea is a powerful reminder of just how intertwined human identity is with the plants we eat.

### Growth, Domestication, and Mobility
Black-eyed peas ([_Vigna unguiculata_](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:1127257-2)) are <span eid="Q44448">leguminous plants</span> that grow best in semi-arid conditions, poor soils, and with little help. They are mainly annual heat-loving and drought-tolerant, and grow quickly, often giving a harvest within 100 days. Archaeological and genetic evidence shows that West Africans domesticated wild relatives of the plant at least 6,000 years ago.[^ref1] Because black-eyed peas mature quickly and produce reliably with only a little land and labor, they are an important part of mixed food systems: wild gathering, hunting, fishing, and <span eid="Q188989">aquaculture</span>, keeping small livestock and/or building larger herds, <span eid="Q397350">agroforestry</span>, and crop cultivation. Diverse specializations protect the community by relying on different foods at different times of the year and ensuring no single crop failure will cause a famine.[^ref2] The ease of growth and usefulness of this crop contributed to its spread from Africa to the Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula, central Asian, and the Indian subcontinent by 1500 BCE.

### Cultural Perceptions in Europe
Since <span eid="Q486761">classical antiquity</span>, the black-eyed pea has been a cultural marker of those who lacked social status in European societies. A stigma surrounding dried foods impinged the reputation of the bean and its eaters: while wealthy and socially powerful individuals could afford fresh foods, peasants relied upon cheaper dried foods. On the whole the beans were shelled, dried, and used in humble soups, though in their fresh green form the black-eyed pea apparently made a delicious dessert served in <span eid="Q5690">Sparta</span>.[^ref3] The imbrication of class, culture, and food is apparent, for example, in ancient Greek and Roman unswept floor <span eid="Q133067">mosaics</span>, which depict food scraps strewn across a floor after a lavish banquet. In perhaps the most famous example of this genre, seen here, lobster shells, olive pits, partially eaten fish, and nuts litter the ground, but nary a bean is to be found.

{#paragraph3}

Authors of the ancient world have described black-eyed peas in accounts of plants and nature. The Roman chronicler <span eid="Q82778">Pliny the Elder</span> (23/24–79 CE) wrote that priests should avoid eating the food for fear its rough nature would upset their delicate constitutions. He also notes that <span eid="Q10261">Pythagoras</span> (c.570–c.495 BCE) and his followers did not eat black-eyed peas because they “believed the souls of the dead to be contained within” the dried beans.[^ref4] This belief may have been informed by some cultural groups in Africa who understood the black eye of the pea as the watchful presence of a supreme deity.[^ref5] Such accounts together with later botanical texts demonstrate a long confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names in Europe, stemming in part from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification.[^ref6] They also provide a wealth of information about the cultural and social role of the bean in the European context.

{#paragraph4}

Records of black-eyed pea consumption and use within Europe during the <span eid="Q12554">Middle Ages</span> are relatively scarce. Understood as a food for peasants and livestock, black-eyed peas would have been considered subject matter too lowly for inclusion in the annals of history. Throughout the <span eid="Q5308718">early modern period</span>, the dried bean continued to be associated with persons of low social standing. Yet the black-eyed pea, now deemed worthy of representation, featured in the Italian artist <span eid="Q7824">Annibale Carracci’s</span> painting _The Bean Eater_, from circa 1590. In it, Carracci used a rough-hewn style of painting to depict the man and his bowl of black-eyed peas, visually articulating their low standing. Even though the peas had been a vital part of the Southern European diet and culture for centuries, they are here presented as both marginal and familiar.

Annibale Carracci was not the only painter to depict beans or peas in late sixteenth-century Europe. Innumerable artists took inspiration from peas—be it their leaves, their delicate blossoms, or their sinuous tendril-filled vines. The peas depicted, however, were not of the black-eyed variety, but rather verdant green peas considered domestic to Europe, such as the <span eid="Q25237">English green pea</span>. The plant became an emblem for love, fertility, and even lust. The fresh green pea was also a food for the elite, and they decorated their homes and gardens accordingly.

### The Pea in Early Modern Texts and Images
Visual representations of black-eyed peas and other varieties of beans and peas shaped European understandings of the plant. Beginning in the sixteenth century, the dramatic rise in the production and circulation of printed texts with images, such as <span eid="Q6165948">herbals</span> or natural histories, reinforced the codification of plants based on their geographic origins. Unprecedented global travel also formed European ideas about the ways in which close observation of the natural world could reveal the domestic or foreign origins of a person, plant, or animal. One result of this study was a shift in European attitudes toward the black-eyed pea.
<param ve-image fit="contain" label="Phaseolus peregrinus IIII, Carolus Clusius, Rariorum Plantarum Historia, Antwerp, Officina Plantiniana apud Ioannem Moretum, 1601. Biblioteca del Real Jardín Botánico, CC BY-NC-SA." url="https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/blob/staging-5/black_eyed_peas/Clusius_Rariorum_Plantarum_Historia_Biblioteca_del_Real_Jardi%CC%81n_Bota%CC%81nico_CC_BY_NC_SA.jpg?raw=true">
{#paragraph7}
       
Despite the millennia-old European presence of the black-eyed pea, it was now understood in Europe as an itinerant body within a Euro-centric <span eid="Q8269924">taxonomy</span> of plants. European travelers visiting Africa, Asia, and the Americas reinforced these ideas. Their observations, often reported in books, were soon understood throughout Europe as factual accounts. For example, Dutchman <span eid="Q3117063">Pieter de Marees’</span> 1602 book, describing West Africa, shows the <span data-click-image-zoomto="418,756,583,437">black-eyed pea</span> in an idealized landscape alongside people and other plants.[^ref7] The viewer is meant to elide the black-eyed pea with Africa’s geography and peoples, this distinction revealing Europe’s increasingly myopic gaze upon the rest of the world.

{#paragraph8}
         
The European perspective is not the only early modern view we have on the black-eyed pea. Written records of the pea appear in the sixteenth century in China where it is noted in the <span eid="Q9903">Ming Dynasty</span> [_Compendium of Materia Medica_](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chinesemedicine/books.html) as (ironically) being a cure for flatulence, as well as kidney problems.[^ref8] And a beautiful illustration of the ‘cowpea’ featured in the extraordinary 30-volume Japanese agricultural encyclopaedia [_Seikei Zuetsu_,](https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/japanese_agriculture_19th_century) published in 1804.[^ref9] Its presence in this Japanese book of crops from 1800 shows how far the black-eyed pea had spread and how its usefulness had been welcomed into many agricultural traditions.

### Food, Culture, and Colonialism
Black-eyed peas, millet, yams, and many other staple foods of the American tropics have African origins. European traders on the coast of West Africa filled hundreds of thousands of vessels with 10-12 million captives over the centuries of the <span eid="Q10701282">transatlantic slave trade</span>.[^ref10] These vessels carried humans-as-commodities as well as the foodstuffs needed for an average voyage of sixty to eighty days.[^ref11] Dry legumes, like black-eyed peas, hyacinth beans and bambara groundnuts, were staple foods cooked into gruel during the <span eid="Q2500942">Middle Passage</span>. Leftover stocks then accompanied captives as they dispersed throughout the Americas and the Caribbean.[^ref12] In Jamaica around 1687, the English physician, naturalist, and planter <span eid="Q310326">Sir Hans Sloane</span> (1660–1753) recorded the presence of the black-eyed pea and extracted a plant to create this herbarium specimen, now housed at the Natural History Museum, London.[^ref13]

In the southern United States, enslaved peoples cultivated black-eyed peas as a crop largely for livestock.[^ref14] However, the peas were also a food served to them as well as a fixture in their kitchen gardens. Numerous first-hand accounts of enslaved peoples mention black-eyed peas. In his 1837 [memoir,](https://archive.org/details/slaveryinunit00ballcha/page/n3/mode/2up?view=theater) Charles Ball (1780–unknown) recalls, “We had plenty of bread, and a supply of black-eyed peas, gathered from our garden, some of which [were] boiled in our kettle.”[^ref15] Francis Fedric wrote of the bean, “The dinner [of enslaved persons] consists generally of black-eyed peas soup, as it is called. About a quart of peas is boiled in a large pan, and a small piece of meat, just to flavour the soup, is put into the pan. The next day it would be bean soup...served out to the men and women in bowls; but the children feed like pigs out of troughs.”[^ref16] Black-eyed peas also held special cultural significance to enslaved Africans; for many of them, the bean was a marker of auspicious occasions, luck and fertility. And it was a food offered both as charity to those in need and as a gift to deities.

<span eid="Q11812">Thomas Jefferson</span> (1743−1826) and <span eid="Q23">George Washington</span> (1732−1799) both had black-eyed peas planted on their expansive plantations, [Monticello](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/slavery/slavery-at-mount-vernon/) and [Mount Vernon,](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/slavery/slavery-at-mount-vernon/) respectively. Washington corresponded with friends and acquaintances about the plant in a 1787 [letter,](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-05-02-0442) in which he writes, “small, and round black eyed Pease called the Gentlemans Pea.”[^ref17] Jefferson considered the cultivation of peas a pursuit worthy of a gentleman, harkening back to European traditions which placed greater social and cultural status on green peas. He held yearly pea growing contests, with the first man to produce a fresh pea required to host a dinner for other gentlemen in the area. These meals, no doubt, transpired under decidedly different conditions than those in which enslaved poeples ate their black-eyed peas.

During the <span eid="Q8676">Civil War</span>, black-eyed peas were associated with the practice of slavery in the North and were therefore deemed undesirable. However, they remained an important food throughout the South so much so that some tired of their ubiquity. In Adelaide Stuart Dimitry’s memoirs of the war years, for instance, she notes that while food was often hard to come by, the black-eyed pea remained a reliable-to the point of tiresome-meal. She recalls: “Once at home came the dinner - where it came from was the daily surprise of life. Sometimes it consisted only of a large platter of newly-dug goobers or [peanuts,](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/peanut/) boiled in salt water, but always sauced with a wondrous appetite - in that dour time never lacking in Richmond... But oh, the eternal, dried, black-eyed pea whether in porridge or soup, baked or boiled, ever the same villainous comestible that made one weary of going to the table!”[^ref18]

{#paragraph13}

In the late nineteenth century, American <span eid="Q2787508">subsistence farmers</span> were encouraged to grow the black-eyed pea even if their local climate meant they did not get an abundant crop of beans. Its usefulness as a soil improver, for erosion control, and as a nutritious fodder for livestock meant that this easy-to-grow crop was a valuable addition to the U.S. farming landscape. Noted American scientist and innovative proponet of crop rotations, <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span> urged farmers in the American South to plant black-eyed peas to help replenish soil depleted by cotton farming. He believed that this easily grown crop could also help lift formerly enslaved peoples out of systemically reinforced poverty. He wrote of the plant: “The cow pea is rightfully looked upon by many as the poor man’s bank or mortgage-lifter... It is a matter of much regret that every colored farmer in Macon County does not plant at least three acres in peas.”[^ref19]

### British Colonial Botany
The black-eyed pea’s global journey is also well documented in the [Economic Botany Collection](https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/collections/economic-botany-collection) of the <span eid="Q18748726">Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</span>. Although the plant was not grown as a crop in Britain (it usually being far too cold and wet), Kew’s holdings demonstrate that it was widely collected and studied in nineteenth-century Britain as a useful plant from across the colonial world. The materials were collected via an extractive process from Nigeria (TYPE), India (TYPE), Laos (TYPE), China (TYPE), and Japan (TYPE). They were also obtained from imperial exhibitions where plant products were displayed, as well as colonial expeditions including <span eid="Q183567">Dr WB Baikie’s</span> Niger Expedition of 1859. Each item can be construed as a micro-history of imperial interests in the colonial world.

### Culinary History and Cultural Celebrations
Today, black-eyed peas are grown commercially in at least 33 countries, reflecting the widespread embrace of the bean among geographically disparate peoples, places, and cultures.[^ref20] As acclaimed food historian and chef Michael Twitty points out: “Very few people in the modern West eat one cuisine or live within one culinary construct,” but rather enjoy a multiplicity of culinary histories.[^ref21] Twitty coined the term “identity cooking” to characterize “how we construct complex identities and then express them through how we eat,” an idea that is useful to keep in mind for any discussion of food as widely used across culinary traditions as black-eyed peas.[^ref22]

Black-eyed peas are a staple of the <span eid="Q49042">Southern American</span> diet and an iconic component of African American culinary history. The peas are key ingredients for everything from stews to salads to savory bean and rice dishes, but perhaps they are most iconic for their modern associations with New Year’s celebrations. <span eid="Q1763911">Hoppin’ John</span> is a popular rice, bean, and pork dish that brings good luck and prosperity. It is often served with greens to symbolize wealth and is an absolute must for any modern Southerner on New Year’s Day. [^ref23] <span eid="Q1810575">Thiebou niebe</span>, a classic Senegalese dish made similarly from black-eyed peas, rice, and ham, may be the basis for the recipe.[^ref24]

Hoppin’ John originated in the brutal conditions of American plantations. Enslaved workers created new meals from West African recipes and the crops they had access to in the New World. They grew black-eyed peas and other African crops in their subsistence gardens outside the long hours they were forced to labor in their enslaver’s fields. Additionally, enslaved women were often made to cook for the planter’s family as well as their own. White southerners at first saw black-eyed peas as a lowly food meant to feed livestock and the enslaved. To them, the peas seemed to fit in alongside the pork scraps used to cook Hoppin’ John.[^ref25] However, by the latter half of the nineteenth century, white women began including recipes from African descendants in their homemaker cookbooks, often without crediting the women who pioneered them.[^ref26]

Brazil’s national dish, <span eid="Q878189">_feijoada completa_</span>, has a very similar origin story to Hoppin’ John. Enslaved West Africans in colonial Brazil developed _feijoada_ on plantations out of black beans and scrap pork.[^ref27] It was a meal of necessity for workers as it used the food on hand and could be left simmering unattended during the long day’s work.[^ref28] Today, simple bean and rice dishes are a national staple, but _feijoada completa_ is a celebratory meal for every sector of society, taking days to prepare and requiring better meat, collard greens, rice, orange slices, and manioc flour (derived from [cassava](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/cassava/)).[^ref29] For both _feijoada completa_ and Hoppin’ John, what was originally a means for survival became a meal for prosperity and celebration, as well as a symbol of unity across racial lines. However, there is still much tension in questions of representation, ownership, class, race and identity in Southern food and <span eid="Q555997"> Soul Food,</span> with white perspectives usually being unjustly prioritized over Black ones.[^ref30]

### Climate Change, Breeding, and Resilience 
Today, the <span eid="Q82151">Food and Agriculture Organization</span> estimates around 7 million tonnes of black-eyed peas are produced annually worldwide.[^ref31] The centers of production are still in Africa, the plant’s ancestral home, with Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania being among the world’s top producers, accounting for 80% of the world’s black-eyed pea crop.[^ref32] It is estimated that it is grown on more than 12 million hectares in many different countries, where it is often intercropped with grains such as sorghum and millet or rice.[^ref33] It is the third most important <span eid="Q379813">pulse</span> worldwide, a crucial element of sustainable agriculture, and feeds hundreds of millions of people.

<span eid="Q11451">Agriculture</span> is already having to adapt to our changing climate, both in terms of practices and in what crops can be grown where. Even though black-eyed peas are considered a very hardy crop, it may struggle as temperatures rise and rains become more erratic with climate change. Crop breeding is one way to make commercial black-eyed peas more resilient, while perhaps also making them more digestible and nutritious. Hardy wild <span eid="Q1141015">relatives</span> of the black-eyed pea may hold genes or genetic traits that will allow this crop to survive hotter, drier conditions, and perhaps be more pest-resistant.[^ref34] If these traits can be bred into commercial varieties then the black-eyed pea may be one of the answers to the many agricultural challenges of the future.

The Crop Wild Relatives Project is researching black-eyed peas in partnership with 33 countries and global seed banks including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and <span eid="Q2603353">RBG Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank</span>.[^ref35] There are currently eleven primary wild relatives of the black-eyed pea being researched. Southern and western Africa are hotspots for wild black-eyed pea genetic variation. The importance of such relatives demonstrates how vital it is to protect wild plants and wild habitats it is here that the answers to our present and future challenges may lie. In a telling [quote](https://www.cwrdiversity.org/cowpea/) from a Nigerian cowpea breeder named Ousame Boukar: “The cowpea has nourished people for many centuries, but now it needs a hand to ensure it can continue to be an unfailing friend even while the climate crisis is affecting production.” Such projects bring us full circle back to the wild plants of Africa, and brings the ancient practices of growing, seed collecting and crop breeding right up to date.

### A Food of the Future
Back-eyed pea’s many names reflect its worldwide appeal. It is known as crowder pea, caupi, southern pea, alubia carilla, neibe and frijole in WHERE, as well as chowlee in India, gubgub in the West Indies, and akkerboon in South Africa.[^rer36] And black-eyed peas and other legumes are globally growing in status as a key cooking ingredient, as well as foods of the future. Highly nutritious and relatively easy to grow, black-eyed peas will no doubt play an important part in future <span eid="Q1229911">food security:</span> providing food in a changing climate and helping small-scale farmers combat poverty and hunger.[^ref37] As the climate gets warmer and more unpredictable, and as human populations grow and resources become more limited, legume crops such as black-eyed peas, with their many virtues, will contribute to the diets of more people.[^ref38]
