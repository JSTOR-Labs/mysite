### A Nut in Name Only
Despite its English name and nutlike taste, the peanut is not a nut. This mighty legume is grown around the world for a variety of uses including human consumption, oil production, and animal feed. It also plays an important role in crop rotation due to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. The taxonomic name of the cultivated peanut, <span eid="Q37383">_Arachis hypogaea_</span>–hypo meaning under and gaea meaning earth–reflects this tropical plant’s ingenious means of reproduction: its aerial flowers undergo fertilization above the ground and burrow into the soil to bear their fruit.

While the largest peanut-producing nations are now China, India, Nigeria, and the United States, the plant was first cultivated by Andean civilizations in South America.[^1] Its migration around the world altered global food production and supply forever, rendering it one of the most successful of New World plants disseminated via the Columbian Exchange.

### The Origins of Peanut Cultivation and Consumption
The peanut is one of many species of the genus [_Arachis_](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30003907-2) with a native range spanning modern-day northern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and part of Brazil. More specifically, the peanut is a natural hyrbid of [two wild species](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/modern-peanut-s-wild-cousin-thought-extinct-found-in-andes/) that originated in what is now <span data-click-map-flyto="-19.922,-64.061, 6">Bolivia</span> 10,000 years ago.[^2] The exact period of peanut cultivation by <span eid="Q3122657">Andean civilizations</span> is unclear but domesticated peanut remains have been dated back more than 7,000 years.[^3] The high protein content of the peanut made it an important calorie-dense feature of the Andean diet.

More than just an important food source, peanuts were also a prestigious item for societal elites, and held symbolic and religious significance in pre-colonial Peru. The <span eid="Q208188">Moche civilization</span> immortalized peanuts in metalwork and on ritual and funerary ceramics, and associated them with death, agricultural production, and fertility, in part because of the peanut’s subterranean growth process.[^4] They were also used in competitive events and as a ceremonial offering. The high status of peanuts is perhaps best immortalized in an elaborate gold and silver necklace from the [royal tombs](http://pdf.blucher.com.br.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/designproceedings/icdhs/icdhs-001.pdf) at Sipán where the warrior-priest leaders of the Moche were buried.[^5]

Mestizo chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539–1616) documented the presence of peanuts in colonial <span eid="Q419">Peru</span>. Born there and educated in Spain, [de la Vega](https://www.learner.org/series/american-passages-a-literary-survey/exploring-borderlands-video/garcilaso-de-la-vega-1539-1616/) drew on direct experience and knowledge of Incan culture shared through his matrilineal relatives to offer a unique perspective on Incan foodways. In his [1609 history of the Inca civilization,](https://archive.org/details/primerapartedelo00vega/page/n443/mode/2up?q=ynchic) the author records peanuts–<span data-click-image-zoomto="278,1157,702,662">_ynchic_</span>–being eaten toasted and, in combination with honey, used to make a kind of nougat. He notes peanuts cause a headache when eaten raw and that peanut oil can be extracted and used to cure many illnesses.[^6]

Peanuts gradually spread further north to <span eid="Q13703">Mesoamerica</span> via trade networks. In the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the location of present-day <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="19.433333, -99.133333,6">Mexico City</span>, the peanut was known as _tlalcacahuatl_ from the words _tlalli_ (earth) and _cacahuatl_ ([cacao](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/cacao/)), giving rise to one of the Spanish words for peanut, _cacahuate/cacahuete_. This suggests that Nahuatl-speaking people may have been the first humans to combine these two now-ubiquitous flavors.[^7]

Although the peanut was less common in Mesoamerica than in South America, it was similarly noted for its medicinal properties. The plant is described in [Book Eleven (“Natural Things”)](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_10622/?sp=282&r=-0.855,0,2.709,1.312,0) of the twelve-volume _Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España_ (General History of the Things of New Spain), completed in 1577. The version of _Historia general_, shown here, is known as the <span eid="Q1106019">_Florentine Codex_</span> because it was acquired by the Medici family of Florence. Compiled by the Spanish Friar <span eid="Q379972">Bernardino de Sahagún</span>, in collaboration with Indigenous authors and artists, the codex provides a comprehensive account of Nahua culture, society, and natural history. Book Eleven describes [_tlalacacahuatl_](https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/content/tlalcacahuatl) as a root that can be ground up into water and given to those with a fever, allowing them to expel the ailment through their urine.[^8]

### Out of the Americas
The Spanish first encountered peanuts in the late fifteenth century on <span eid="Q25277">Hispaniola</span>, the largest island of the West Indies, where they were called _maní_ in the Indigenous <span eid="Q5232952">Taíno</span> language. _Maní_ remains the predominant name in Latin America today, having been adopted into Spanish. Diverging from the appreciation of peanuts by many Indigenous societies, Spanish chronicler <span eid="Q919967">Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés</span> (1478–1557) linked their consumption on Hispaniola to people of low social standing who were not “true Christians.”[^9] Because the Spanish associated peanuts with Hispaniola as well as the continental Americas, there was confusion about the plant’s origins until the nineteenth century, when peanut remains found in a pre-colonial tomb in Peru helped establish its origins in South America.[^10]

From there, it spread across the continent.

The first mention of peanuts in a Chinese text dates to 1503, a mere decade after Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of the Americas. The manuscript describes boiled or cooked peanuts as “delicious” and gives the origin of its Chinese name 落花生 _luo hua sheng_ (commonly now just 花生 _hua sheng_), literally “born from a fallen flower,” which references how the peanut fruits below ground.[^11] Historical records related to <span eid="Q1015805">Changshu county</span> indicate that peanuts were cultivated there as early as 1538.[^12] Cultivation expanded to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="23.17, 113.27, 5">Guangdong</span> by the seventeenth century and in the following century, to the Guangdong delta and Taiwan.

In China, peanuts were a luxury food served at banquets and out of reach for many until the nineteenth century. The peanut came to be imbued with cultural meanings as well, as shown in this <span eid="Q8733">Qing Dynasty</span> agate carving depicting a pair of peanuts alongside red dates. The carving is a play on words: the characters for red date (枣, _zao_) and peanut (生, _sheng_), are homophones for the first two characters of the auspicious greeting [早生贵子 zao sheng gui zi,](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/44155?ft=peanut&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=40&amp;pos=13) an encouragement for newlywed couples to soon have children.

### Mass Consumption: Peanuts as American Staple       
Peanuts’ journey north from South America was circuitous—in fact, they were introduced to the United States through Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hulls of slave ships. This [history is embedded in the language of peanuts](https://collections.telfair.org/objects/6549/untitled-peanuts)—the common moniker “goober” entered American English from _nguba_ in Kimbundu, a language spoken in Angola; “pinder,” another term for peanuts in the American South, derives from _mpinda_ in the Kongo language.[^13]

In contrast to the peanut’s high status in the pre-colonial Americas and Qing China, in the early nineteenth-century United States, peanuts were often planted by communities of enslaved persons and otherwise used as feed for livestock. It was during the <span eid="Q8676">Civil War</span> that they became more widely popular among southern whites. Southerners turned to peanuts in the face of wartime food shortages, and the crop’s military utility was exploited as peanut oil replaced embargoed northern whale oil as machinery lubricant.[^14] The popularity of peanuts at the time is commemorated in “Goober Peas,” a folk song sung by Confederate soldiers. The lyrics and music are humorously attributed to “A. Pinder” and “P. Nut,” both puns on the peanut’s name. 
<param ve-image label="Lyrics of the folk song “Goober Peas,” printed in Southern Enterprise, Thomasville, Georgia, U.S., May 9, 1866, RCraig09, Wikimedia Commons, public domain." url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/18660509_Goober_Peas_-_lyrics_-_Thomasville_Southern_Enterprise_%28Georgia%29.jpg/1107px-18660509_Goober_Peas_-_lyrics_-_Thomasville_Southern_Enterprise_%28Georgia%29.jpg">
{#paragraph13}

After the war, spurred on by advances in agricultural technology, the use of peanut spread throughout the country. Instrumental to this was <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span> (c.1864–1943), the pioneering [Black agricultural scientist](https://libguides.nybg.org/c.php?g=1003078&p=7264400) who devoted much of his career to popularizing the crop in the South. Carver, who was born into slavery in Missouri and taught at the Tuskegee Institute during his scientific career, sought to promote crops that could be planted as an alternative to cotton. Carver proposed the cultivation of peanuts as a means to rectify the widespread nutrient depletion and erosion in southern soils caused by the monoculture of cotton. As nitrogen-fixing legumes, peanuts could return nutrients to the soil as part of a crop rotation that would boost the yield of future cotton plantings.

A [1916 Tuskegee Institute report](https://archive.org/details/CAT31355406/page/n2/mode/1up) illustrates Carver’s creativity in devising 105 recipes for peanut-based foods. He also invented a number of other uses for peanuts, including products made from peanut oil.[^15] An influential Black public figure during the age of segregation, Carver promoted peanut production on a local and a national scale, and in 1922 testified before Congress on behalf of peanut farmers for establishing protections for domestic peanuts against rising Chinese imports.[^16] Peanuts were now associated with agricultural advancement and culinary innovation—and their star was still on the rise.

Today, while the United States is the fourth-largest peanut producer in the world, Americans consume the greatest quantity of peanuts annually of any nation. This is due in part to the widespread popularity of peanut butter–a distinctly North American foodstuff.[^17] While George Washington Carver is sometimes credited with the invention of peanut butter, U.S. patents for “peanut paste” and “nut butter” began to appear in the late nineteenth century. They included recipes calling for roasting and shelling the peanuts, and then grinding the nuts until they congeal into a paste, with salt and oil as optional additions. At first a tea-time delicacy, peanut butter was marketed as a protein-packed meat replacement during the food rationing of World War I, and its utility as a cheap energy source made it ubiquitous during the Great Depression.

In the first half of the twentieth century, a series of relentless American ad campaigns marketed peanut butter as suitable for all kinds of dishes, from peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate-peanut candies to savory roasts and soups. The <span eid="Q605269">American Empire</span> shaped the peanut-related foodways of its colonies as well, including the Philippines.[^18] And the peanut is comparatively prevalent in Germany due to the historical and contemporary presence of American troops.

### Selling Peanuts in Public Spaces
A characteristic feature in the history and contemporary life of peanuts is their presence in public spaces. The peanut vendor sells peanuts: roasted or boiled, shelled or de-shelled, in street carts or on the roadside, in cones of newspaper or in paper bags. It is a global practice with similarities and differences specific to local context. Journalist Jori Lewis, for example, has [explored](https://civileats.com/2022/04/12/slaves-for-peanuts-tells-the-tragic-story-behind-americas-favorite-snack/) the significance of peanut vendors in the late nineteenth-century U.S. According to Lewis, vendors faced public scorn due to pejorative associations of the peanut with enslaved persons and Black people in the South, and stereotypes of race and class.[^19]

In contrast to the peanut vendor’s low social status in the late nineteenth-century U.S., the popularity of the street vendor in 1920s Havana is brilliantly conveyed by the song <span eid="Q3050049">_El manisero_ (_The Peanut Vendor_)</span> by the Cuban composer and songwriter <span eid="Q661928">Moisés Simons</span>.[^20] The 1927 composition is sung from the perspective of the seller and is an example of the African and Afro-Cuban-influenced <span eid="Q4428744">_son_</span> and <span eid="Q5681688">_pregón_</span> genres. Recorded over 160 times, the lyrics tell of a vendor trying to tempt a housewife to buy a cone of peanuts: his repeated sales cry of “_maní_, _maní_, _maní_,” is a typical feature of _pregones_. In 2005, the Library of Congress added _El manisero_ to the [National Recording Registry](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/registry-by-induction-years/2005/) in recognition of its influence in the history of Latin American music.

Besides selling peanuts on streets and roadsides, vendors in the late nineteenth-century U.S. also were working in other public spaces like circuses, zoos, theaters, and fairs. Because vendors sold the peanuts in the shell, it became commonplace for purchasers to eat the delicious nuts and discard the shells on the ground. By the mid-1920s, many cities prohibited the sale of in-shell peanuts to curb littering.[^21] While peanut shells were considered litter in public spaces, the hull and broken peas left over from the industrial de-shelling process were used in the preparation of livestock feed, especially during years of low-quality crops or poor prices.

### The Groundnut Scheme in East Africa
Peanuts played a critical role in the British Empire, as well, as demonstrated by the <span eid="Q2392428">Tanganyika groundnut scheme</span>. In 1946, British businessmen and civil servants developed a plan to clear vast areas of vegetation in Tanganyika for establishing a groundnut monoculture. The aim was to produce enough peanuts to supply Britain, still under government-enforced World War II rationing, with cooking oil and improve food provisions in colonial territories. Historical and environmental geographer Martin Mahoney has [explained](http://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/enemy-nature-military-machines-and-technological-bricolage-britains-great-agricultural) how officials repurposed military technologies to wage a “war” against nature.[^22] Because they failed to adequately consider environmental conditions, crops did not yield as expected and the British government abandoned the project in 1951.

Humans, animals, and birds are not the only consumers of the peanut plant for its nutrients. According to texts on peanut cultivation for human consumption, insects, fungi, and bacteria feed on peanut foliage, subterranean parts, and pods.[^23] Indeed, insects like the <span eid="Q779383">Indian meal moth</span>, <span eid="Q2893450">almond moth</span>, <span eid="Q779905">sawtoothed grain beetle </span>, and <span eid="Q20165096">flour beetle</span> consume peanuts when they are in storage. This infestation by pests causes crop damage resulting in economic loss for producers.

Bacteria and fungi also leave their unique markers of consumption: “...<span eid="Q4840003">bacterial wilt</span> in the East Indies, rosette in Africa, and <span eid="Q6508875">leaf spot</span> in the southern United States.”[^24] That said, the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="195,105,766,725">roots</span> of the peanut plant are also noted as the center for multi-species reciprocity, with <span eid="Q9164450">nitrogen-fixing bacteria</span> taking from and giving back to the soil. Even after harvesting the plant, the peanut shells are sometimes returned to the soil as fertilizer–to be, again, consumed by the soil.[^25]

### No Meager Legume
Despite the use of the word [peanut](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peanut) to denote a small or meager amount in the English language, we have seen over the course of this essay that the peanut has a rich history that is intricately tied to histories of global trade, slavery, and colonization. From luxury food to livestock feed, the social, cultural, and economic life of this legume has taken on many incarnations. Yet its importance to humans and its ecosystems is hard to overstate. The peanut plant heals and replenishes soils and has therefore been cultivated as a global environmental intervention method to maintain soil health. Highly nutritious and protein-packed, it is beneficial to the many life-forms that consume it–including to humans in their varied culinary preparations.
