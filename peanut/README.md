### A Nut in Name Only
Despite its English name and nutlike taste, the peanut is not a nut. This mighty legume is grown around the world for a variety of uses including human consumption, oil production, and animal feed. It also plays an important role in crop rotation due to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. The taxonomic name of the cultivated peanut, <span eid="Q37383">_Arachis hypogaea_</span>–hypo meaning under and gaea meaning earth–reflects this tropical plant’s ingenious growth method: its flowers protect themselves from cool, night-time temperatures by burrowing into the ground to bear their fruit.

### The Origins of Peanut Cultivation and Consumption
The cultivated peanut is one of many species of the _Arachis_ genus that is thought to have originated east of the Andes mountain range in the area corresponding to modern-day northwestern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, and western Brazil.[^2] The exact period of peanut cultivation by <span eid="Q3122657">Andean civilizations</span> is unclear but domesticated peanut remains have been dated back more than 7,000 years.[^3] The high protein content of the peanut made it an important calorie-dense feature of the Andean diet. In his [1609 history of the Inca civilization,](https://archive.org/details/primerapartedelo00vega/page/n443/mode/2up?q=ynchic) mestizo chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539–1616) records peanuts–<span data-click-image-zoomto="278,1157,702,662">_ynchic_</span>–being eaten toasted and, in combination with honey, used to make a kind of nougat. Garcilaso notes peanuts cause a headache when eaten raw and that peanut oil can be extracted and used to cure many illnesses.[^4]

More than just an important food source, peanuts were also a prestigious item for societal elites, and held symbolic and religious importance. The <span eid="Q208188">Moche culture</span> in northern <span eid="Q419">Peru</span> immortalized peanuts in metalwork and on ritual and funerary ceramics, and associated them with death, agricultural production, and fertility, in part because of the peanut’s subterranean growth process.[^5] They were also used in competitive events and as a ceremonial offering. The high status of peanuts is perhaps best immortalized in an elaborate gold and silver necklace that was discovered in the excavation of the Royal Tombs of Sipán in the 1980s where the warrior-priest leaders of the Moche were buried.[^6]

Peanuts were also held in high regard in <span eid="Q13703">Mesoamerica</span>, having gradually spread further north via trade networks. In the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the location of present-day <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="19.433333, -99.133333,6">Mexico City</span>, the peanut was known as _tlalcacahuatl_ from the words _tlalli_ (earth) and _cacahuatl_ ([cacao](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/cacao/)), giving rise to one of the Spanish words for peanut, _cacahuate/cacahuete_. This suggests that the Mexica may have been the first humans to combine these two now-ubiquitous flavors.[^7]

Although the peanut was less common in Mesoamerica than in South America, it was similarly noted for its medicinal properties. The plant is described and visually represented in [Book Eleven (“On Earthly Things”)](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_10622/?sp=282&r=-0.855,0,2.709,1.312,0) of the twelve-volume codex _Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España_ (General History of the Things of New Spain), completed in 1577. The version shown here is known as the <span eid="Q1106019">Florentine Codex</span> because it was acquired by the Medici family of Florence and has since been conserved at the Laurentian Library. The Spanish Friar <span eid="Q379972">Bernardino de Sahagún</span>, compiled information for the codex in collaboration with Indigenous authors and artists, which provided a comprehensive account of Nahua culture, society, and natural history in order to facilitate Spanish evangelization work. Book Eleven describes [_tlalacacahuatl_](https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/content/tlalcacahuatl) as a root that can be ground up into water and given to those with a fever, allowing them to expel the ailment through their urine.[^8]

### Out of the Americas
The Spanish first encountered peanuts in the late fifteenth century on <span eid="Q25277">Hispaniola</span>, the largest island of the West Indies, where they were called _maní_ in the Indigenous <span eid="Q5232952">Taíno</span> language. _Maní_ remains the predominant name in Latin America today, having been adopted into Spanish. Diverging from the appreciation of peanuts by many Indigenous societies, Spanish chronicler <span eid="Q919967">Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés</span> linked their consumption on Hispaniola to people of low social standing who were not “true Christians.”[^9] The Spanish associated them with Hispaniola as well as the continental Americas, which led to confusion about the plant’s origins until the nineteenth century, when peanut remains were found in a pre-colonial tomb in Peru.[^10]

<span eid="Q683846">Spanish galleons</span> transported peanuts westward from the Americas to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="15.20,131.31">China, the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands</span> throughout the sixteenth century. Simultaneously, peanuts were being transported across the world by the Portuguese, who encountered the legume in Brazil around 1500, to the <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="-16.13,-12.30">Portuguese enclaves on the west coast of Africa</span>. From there, it spread across the continent. The peanut was often used as sustenance for enslaved peoples as it could be stored for long periods of time and its hard outer shell helped protect it from spoilage. From Africa, the peanut traveled to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="2.64,60.29">Portuguese enclaves in India</span>, where it was initially termed the “Mozambique bean,” and eventually to China.

The first mention of peanuts in a Chinese text dates to 1503, a mere decade after Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of the Americas. The manuscript describes boiled or cooked peanuts as “delicious” and gives the origin of its Chinese name 落花生 _luo hua sheng_ (commonly now just 花生 _hua sheng_), literally “born from a fallen flower,” which is how peanuts were thought to grow.[^11] Over the next centuries, peanuts became popular throughout China, spreading inland from the trading ports of southern coastal cities. Though now ubiquitous in Chinese cuisine, peanuts were a luxury food served at banquets and out of reach for many until the nineteenth century. The peanut came to be imbued with new cultural meanings as well, as shown in the <span eid="Q8733">Qing Dynasty</span> agate carving to the right depicting a pair of peanuts alongside red dates. The carving is a play on words: the characters for red date (枣, _zao_) and peanut (生, _sheng_), are homophones for the first two characters of the auspicious greeting 早生贵子 zao sheng gui zi, an encouragement for newlywed couples to soon have children.[^12]

### Mass Consumption: Peanuts as American Staple       
Peanuts’ journey north from South America was circuitous—in fact, they were introduced to the United States through Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hulls of slave ships. This [history is embedded in the language of peanuts](https://collections.telfair.org/objects/6549/untitled-peanuts)—the common moniker “goober” entered American English from _nguba_ in Kimbundu, a language spoken in Angola; “pinder,” another term for peanuts in the American South, derives from _mpinda_ in the Kongo language.[^13]

In contrast to the peanut’s high status in the pre-colonial Americas and Qing China, in early nineteenth-century United States, peanuts were often planted by communities of enslaved persons and otherwise used as feed for livestock. It was during the <span eid="Q8676">Civil War</span> that they became more widely popular among southern whites. Southerners turned to peanuts in the face of wartime food shortages, and the crop’s military utility was exploited as peanut oil replaced embargoed northern whale oil as machinery lubricant.[^14] The popularity of peanuts at the time is commemorated in “Goober Peas,” a folk song sung by Confederate soldiers. The lyrics and music are humorously attributed to “A. Pinder” and “P. Nut,” both puns on the peanut’s name. 
<param ve-image label="Lyrics of the folk song “Goober Peas,” printed in Southern Enterprise, Thomasville, Georgia, U.S., May 9, 1866, RCraig09, Wikimedia Commons, public domain." url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/18660509_Goober_Peas_-_lyrics_-_Thomasville_Southern_Enterprise_%28Georgia%29.jpg/1107px-18660509_Goober_Peas_-_lyrics_-_Thomasville_Southern_Enterprise_%28Georgia%29.jpg">
{#paragraph11}

After the war, spurred on by advances in agricultural technology, the use of peanut spread throughout the country. Instrumental to this was <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span> (c.1864–1943), the pioneering [Black agricultural scientist](https://libguides.nybg.org/c.php?g=1003078&p=7264400) who devoted much of his career to popularizing the crop in the South. Carver, who was born into slavery in Missouri and taught at the Tuskegee Institute during his scientific career, sought to promote crops that could be planted as an alternative to cotton. Carver proposed the cultivation of peanuts as a means to rectify the widespread nutrient depletion and erosion in southern soils caused by the monoculture of cotton. As nitrogen-fixing legumes, peanuts could return nutrients to the soil as part of a crop rotation that would boost the yield of future cotton plantings.

A [1916 Tuskegee Institute report](https://archive.org/details/CAT31355406/page/n2/mode/1up) illustrates Carver’s creativity in devising 105 recipes for peanut-based foods. He also invented a number of other uses for peanuts, including products made from peanut oil.[^15] An influential Black public figure during the age of segregation, Carver promoted peanut production on a local and a national scale, and in 1922 testified before Congress on behalf of peanut farmers for establishing protections for domestic peanuts against rising Chinese imports.[^16] Peanuts were now associated with agricultural advancement and culinary innovation—and their star was still on the rise.

Today, while the United States is the fourth-largest peanut producer in the world, Americans consume the greatest quantity of peanuts annually of any nation. This is due in part to the widespread popularity of peanut butter–a distinctly North American foodstuff.[^17] While George Washington Carver is sometimes credited with the invention of peanut butter, U.S. patents for “peanut paste” and “nut butter” began to appear in the late nineteenth century. They contained recipes calling for roasting and shelling the peanuts, and then grinding the nuts until they congeal into a paste, with salt and oil as optional additions. At first a tea-time delicacy, peanut butter was marketed as a protein-packed meat replacement during the food rationing of World War I, and its utility as a cheap energy source made it ubiquitous during the Great Depression.

A series of relentless American ad campaigns marketed peanut butter as suitable for all kinds of dishes, from peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate-peanut candies to savory roasts and soups. The American Empire shaped the peanut-related foodways of its colonies as well, including the Philippines.[^18] And the peanut is comparatively prevalent in Germany due to the historical and contemporary presence of American troops.

### Politics and Public Space
A characteristic feature in the history and contemporary life of peanuts is their presence in public spaces. The peanut vendor sells peanuts: roasted or boiled, shelled or de-shelled, in street carts or on the roadside, in cones of newspaper or in paper bags. It is a global practice with similarities and differences specific to local context. As a result, the peanut vendor is both a mediator in peanut consumption and a symbol in various forms of media.
<param ve-image primary fit="contain" label="Street vendor selling roasted peanuts, pub. in Harold J. Clay, Paul M. Williams, Bulletin of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1926, no. 1401, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Library via BHL, public domain." url="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageimage/48681087#page/57/mode/1up">

{#paragraph16}

The significance of the peanut vendor as the mediator in peanut consumption is brilliantly conveyed by the 1927 song <span eid="Q3050049">_El manisero_ (_The Peanut Vendor_)</span> by the Cuban composer and songwriter <span eid="Q661928">Moisés Simons</span>.[^19] The composition is sung from the perspective of the seller and is an example of the African and Afro-Cuban-influenced <span eid="Q4428744">_son_</span> and <span eid="Q5681688">_pregón_</span> genres. Recorded over 160 times, the lyrics tell of a vendor trying to tempt a housewife to buy a cone of peanuts: his repeated sales cry of “_maní_, _maní_, _maní_,” is a typical feature of _pregones_. In 2005, the Library of Congress added _El manisero_ to the [National Recording Registry](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/registry-by-induction-years/2005/) in recognition of its influence in the history of Latin American music.

{#paragraph17}

Besides selling peanuts on streets and roadsides, vendors also were working in other public spaces like circuses, zoos, theaters, and fairs. The ubiquitous presence of peanuts as entertainment food in circus spaces led to spectators feeding them to the animals, including elephants, as exemplified by this 1897 theatrical poster featuring a visitor offering the circus elephant a peanut.[^20] It is now understood that peanuts are not good for elephants as they require more fiber than protein in their diet.

{#paragraph18}

Interestingly, the text [_Marketing Peanuts_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/190773#page/9/mode/1up), published in 1926 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, prohibits the sale of shelled peanuts in public and amusement spaces in some cities to curb littering of peanut shells.[^21] While peanut shells were considered litter in public spaces, the hull and broken peas left over from the industrial de-shelling process were used in the preparation of livestock feed, especially during years of low-quality crops or poor prices.

### The Groundnut Scheme in East Africa
Peanuts played a critical role in the British Empire, as well, as demonstrated by the <span eid="Q2392428">Tanganyika groundnut scheme</span>, which took place between 1946 and 1951. In his account of the scheme to clear vast areas of vegetation to establish a groundnut monoculture in Tanganyika, [“Martin Mahony”](http://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/enemy-nature-military-machines-and-technological-bricolage-britains-great-agricultural) not only notes a continued rhetoric of being at “war” with the land in Tanganyika, but also the actual _repurposing of war machines into agricultural equipment_: “At the sites chosen for the groundnut scheme, tractors and bulldozers from military surplus stores in Egypt proved unable to tackle the hard ground and tough vegetation, so the planners turned to a novel solution: repurposing surplus <span eid="Q191643">Sherman M4A2 tanks</span>.”[^22] With inadequate consideration given to the conditions of climate and land, the crops did not yield as expected and the scheme was ultimately recorded as a large-scale agricultural failure. The British Government had to abandon the scheme. Today groundnuts are grown in present-day Tanzania by smallholder farmers, and rank [“12th”](https://www.atlasbig.com/en-in/countries-by-peanut-production) in global peanut production.

### Multispecies Consumption: Insects, Fungi, Bacteria
Humans, animals, and birds are not the only consumers of the peanut plant for its nutrients. In texts on peanut cultivation for human consumption, like _The Peanut: The Unpredictable legume; A Symposium_ published in 1951 by the National Fertilizer Association, we find the assertive presence of insects, fungi, and bacteria that feed on the peanut foliage, subterranean parts, and delicious pods.[^23] Insects like the <span eid="Q779383">Indian meal moth</span>, <span eid="Q2893450">almond moth</span>, <span eid="Q779905">sawtoothed grain beetle </span>, and <span eid="Q20165096">flour beetle</span> are observed consuming peanuts when they are in storage. This infestation by pests causes crop damage resulting in economic damage to producers.

Bacteria and fungi also leave their unique markers of consumption: “...<span eid="Q4840003">bacterial wilt</span> in the East Indies, <span eid="Q58935125">rosette</span> in Africa, and <span eid="Q6508875">leaf spot</span> in the southern United States.”[^24] That said, the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="195,105,766,725">roots</span> of the peanut plant are also noted as the center for multi-species reciprocity, with <span eid="Q9164450">nitrogen-fixing bacteria</span> taking from and giving back to the soil. Even after harvesting the plant, the peanut shells are sometimes returned to the soil as fertilizer–to be, again, consumed by the soil.[^25]

### No Meager Legume
Despite the use of the word [peanut](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peanut) to denote a small or meager amount in the English language, we have seen over the course of this essay that the peanut has a rich global history that is intricately tied to histories of colonization. From luxury food to livestock feed, the social, cultural, and political life of this legume has taken on many incarnations. Yet its importance to humans and its ecosystems is hard to overstate. The peanut plant heals and replenishes soils and has therefore been cultivated as a global environmental intervention method to maintain soil health.
