### The Power of Peony
In 1735, a Viennese baroness wrote to the last Medici princess, <span id="Q233181">Anna Maria Luisa de Medici (1669-1743)</span>,  to thank her for sending a miraculous infant convulsion powder. In her letter, the baroness praised the powder’s effectiveness and stated that the children she treated with it had been so violently taken by convulsions that the physicians had “given up on them.” Not only had the “miraculous powder” cured the children, the baroness also stated that a number of months had passed, and the children remained in perfect health. Anna Maria Luisa was well known for her miraculous powder, which she distributed strategically to influential individuals and courts across Europe.

Anna Maria Luisa’s recipe for infant convulsion powder contained a precipitation of a human skull of a man (who died violently but was never buried), a precipitation of “Oriental pearls,” a precipitation of red coral and white coral, as well as yellow amber and peony roots and seeds. While the more outrageous ingredients such as pulverized human skull and Oriental pearls stand out, it was actually the use of peony that made Anna Maria Luisa’s powder effective and enabled her to create valuable political alliances and protect <span id="Q154849">The Grand Duchy of Tuscany</span> as the end of the Medici dynasty neared.

### Shaoyao: The Medicine Made from Peony
While today we think of peonies as beautiful ornamental flowers, for more than a millennium, they have been used as medicinal plants. Peony is the single genus in the _Paeoniaceae_ family, which has about 30 species found in western North America, Northwest Africa, and temperate Eurasia. China, with 15 species, 10 of which are endemic, is the center of the family’s bio-geographic distribution.

Two species of _Paeonia_ were particularly important in ancient Chinese medical practice, <span id="Q163076">_Paeonia lactiflora_</span>, which was the primary source of both white peony and red peony, and , <span id="Q163018">_Paeonia suffruticosa_</span>, commonly known as the tree peony or “moutan”. The earliest record of the use of peony in Chinese medicine was discovered in an imperial Chinese Han tomb (AD 25–220). Writings within the tomb confirmed that peony root (called “danpi”), likely _P._ _suffruticosa_, was used to treat blood stasis nearly 2,000 years ago.[^1]

More than a millennium later in 1644, and a testament to peony’s long history as an important medicinal simple, a high <span id="Q9903">Ming</span> illustrated <span id="Q6165948">herbal</span>, _Bencao tupu_ 本草圖譜, beautifully depicted _P. lactiflora_, also known as common Chinese garden peony. According to the herbal, _P. lactiflora_ was used to treat gynecological symptoms including hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles. It was also used in the treatment of high blood pressure and inflammation.[^2] The compound Chinese character “Shaoyao” for _P. lactiflora_, written in the top right corner of the image, reveals the plant’s importance in medicine. The first character “shao” is the term referring to the peony plant, while the second character “yao” means medicine. Thus, shaoyao means “the medicine made from peony.”[^3]

### Peony in Western Medicine
Outside of China, peony had an equally long history of medicinal use in Europe. In his herbal, <span id="Q3704131">_de Materia Medica_</span>, the Greek physician <span id="Q297776">Dioscorides</span> identified two types of peonies used in medicine: the male and female peony. Today these are identified as <span id="Q161482">_Paeonia mascula_</span> and <span id="Q159738">_Paeonia officinalis_</span> respectively. According to <span id="Q457191">Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s</span> 16th century commentary on _de Materia Medica_, Dioscorides prescribed giving the dry root of _P. officinalis_ to women to provoke menstruation (an <span id="Q2602077">emmenagogue</span>) and to treat kidney and bladder discomfort among several other gynecological ailments. The Roman naturalist, <span id="Q82778">Pliny the Elder</span>, also recommended _P. officinalis_ for “female diseases,” stating, “[One great remedy for all female diseases in common, is the black seed of the herbaceous plant pæonia](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:26.90).”

In addition to the “cleansing” and purgative properties associated with peony and women’s health, the Roman physician <span id="Q8778">Galen</span> recommended tying peony root around the necks of children as an effective remedy for “the falling sickness,” which was a common pre-modern phrase for <span id="Q41571">epilepsy</span>.[^4] Throughout the middle ages, peony continued to be used as a medicinal simple for the treatment of epilepsy or convulsions. For example, the female medieval healer and Benedictine abbess, <span id="Q70991">Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179)</span> instructed “When one falls with epilepsy, place in his mouth [peony] while he lies there, and do this every time he falls with this disease, and he will be finally cured.”[^5] In addition to treating epilepsy, fits, and convulsions, peony was also used as a cure for lunacy and sciatica.

<span id="Q6165948">European printed herbals</span> of the sixteenth century continued to prescribe peony for seizures and epilepsy. While many of these herbals still referenced Galen’s recommendation to tie the root around the necks of children, they also prescribed more powerful peony therapeutics in the form of distilled waters, powders, syrups, and compound medicines to be taken internally. For example, <span id="Q205031">Castore Durante’s</span> popular Italian herbal printed in 1585 described how distilled water of female peony root and flowers relieved children who suffered from “mal caduco” (epilepsy or seizures). He also noted that it benefited apoplectics and paralytics as well. Similarly, in his 1597 herbal, English naturalist <span id="Q1333338">John Gerard</span> noted that a syrup made from peony “helpeth greatly the falling sickness, likewise the extraction of on the rootes doth the same.”

### Nature's Pharmaceuticals
As we can see, for more than two thousand years numerous peony species were used as a powerful herbal therapeutic across societies in Europe and Asia. <span id="Q861699">Herbal medicine</span> in the western tradition, however, changed dramatically over the course of the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as European chemists, botanists, and physicians began favoring the creation of <span id="Q7806442">standardized and systematic medical experimentation</span> to assess the efficacy of plant medicines and identify and isolate their active chemical compounds. This led to an emphasis on the individual organic compounds within plants and the organic chemical synthesis of these compounds to produce more effective drugs. It also marked the birth of modern pharmaceuticals, many of which are derived or synthetic analogues of naturally occurring chemical structures. The ability to isolate, purify, and synthesize chemical structures created <span id="Q507443">highly efficacious and powerful drugs</span>. Thus, despite being the antecedent of modern chemical pharmaceuticals, herbal simples and compound herbal medicines were slowly replaced and increasingly viewed as outdated, crude, ineffectual, and, in some cases, even dangerous.

While modern western medicine tends to dismiss pre-modern therapeutics like Anna Maria Luisa’s infant convulsion powder, numerous scientific studies on several species of peony used medically in East Asia have revealed isolated compounds that possess antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic properties.[^6] Peony roots and flowers continue to be used as a medicinal simple in <span id="Q261503">Traditional Chinese</span> and <span id="Q132325">Ayurvedic</span> medicine. While fewer studies have been conducted on European species of peony used medicinally, there have been several studies conducted to test for the bioactive compounds responsible for _P. officinalis’s_ effect on seizures.

A study conducted in 1991 on the water extract of _P. officinalis_ concluded that there are several chemical compounds found in the root, including <span id="Q7124104">paeoniflorin</span>, albiflorin, oxypaeoniflorin, and gallotannins that have documented anticonvulsant properties.[^7] Furthermore, when isolated, the compounds albiflorin and gallotannin were proven to block extracellular calcium, which is linked to intracellular seizure-related phenomena. Paeoniflorin fractions also showed inhibition, but to a weaker extent. An additional study, which administered peony root extract (from _P. officinalis_) to rats, concluded that it was “a potent in vitro inhibitor of neuron damage in the CA1 area of the hippocampus.” The study also determined that peony root extract had protective effects on damaged neurons as well as anticonvulsant action when administered orally. Finally, the administration of antiepileptic drugs early has the potential to [alter the long-term course of epilepsy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29726099), with the possibility of preventing it from becoming an “intractable disorder.”

Today, the primary approach to treating epilepsy and suppressing seizures is to alter the neural network’s excitability or inhibition by regulating chemical compounds such as sodium and calcium. Drugs like <span id="Q421567">ethosuximide</span> reduce abnormal electrical activity in the brain by regulating calcium influx in cells. Thus, in contemporary western medicine there is little market demand to further investigate the peony root’s similar biochemical compounds or potential pharmaceutical applications. This lack of contemporary interest, however, does not make the biochemical activity of peony insignificant historically. The identification of active biochemical compounds suggest that Anna Maria Luisa’s powder might have actually improved the health of the children who received it!

The probable effectiveness of her infant convulsion powder increased Anna Maria Luisa’s socio-political influence. In fact, several letters preserved in the Florence State Archive attest to the powder’s efficacy and popularity. In one such letter, the previously mentioned Viennese baroness wrote again to Anna Maria Luisa requesting additional portions of powder given the “extraordinary effects they had on three children from the most important families of Vienna.” Anna Maria Luisa replied that she would send the baroness as much of the powder as she desired to distribute to her friends, considering that she had “put the powder to such good use.”

The gift of “miraculous” medicine to the Viennese court was not simply altruistic. As a woman, Anna Maria Luisa was barred from inheriting and ruling Tuscany on the death of her brother, the <span id="Q256580">last Medici Grand Duke</span>. Although she lacked official power, Anna Maria Luisa fashioned influence through the gift of her infant convulsion powder, which allowed her to ingratiate herself with some of Vienna’s most important and powerful families. This ensured goodwill and communication between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the court that would decide its fate. By the end of the Medici dynasty, the Viennese court was the headquarters of the  <span id="Q256580">Habsburg dynasty</span> and the center of its imperial politics. In 1737, <span id="Q151075">Francis of Lorraine</span>, future head of the <span id="Q12548">Holy Roman Empire</span> which controlled much of Europe at this time, became the Grand Duke of Tuscany and ruled Florence from the imperial court in Vienna—a court much indebted to Anna Maria Luisa’s infant convulsion powder and the power of peony.
