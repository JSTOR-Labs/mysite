### Portrait from Life

In the mid-1860s, the artist Philippe Lambotte (fl. 1860s–1870s) created a stunning portrait of nepenthes from life that was reproduced as a chromolithograph.[^ref1] The print shows a full-length view of [_Nepenthes hookerii_](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:603725-1) against a pale blue-and-gold background to emphasize this plant’s vibrant foliage and chandelier-like form.[^ref2] Aesthetic characteristics further explored in two close-up views: one depicts a green-and-maroon <span data-click-image-zoomto="1891,2724,1567,1453">lamina (leaf blade)</span> with slightly curled edges and the other depicts a <span data-click-image-zoomto="4155,3695,1567,1405">pitcher (modified leaf)</span> with speckled red-violet markings and fringed wings. Remarkably, <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">the nepenthes</span> on which Lambotte based his design was grown far from its native ecosystem and range—the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia—in Paris.[^ref3] A feat of horticultural ingenuity commemorated in this picture, which was published in Adolphe Alphand’s [_Les Promenades de Paris_,](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i)from 1868–73.

Lambotte documented a nepenthes plant newly cultivated at Paris’ Fleuriste de la Muette.[^ref3] This civic nursery propagated enough ornamental plants to supply all the city’s municipal gardens.[^ref4] <span data-click-image-zoomto="4">Its glasshouse</span>  designed for growing nepenthes was depicted in several architectural drawings. <span data-click-image-zoomto="1901,4952,2569,2176">The lower longitudinal section</span> shows one corner of the building attached to a cutting-edge steam and water heating system, which simulated a tropical climate. The extent to which nepenthes decorated Parisian parks, such as the <span data-click-image-zoomto="5">Bois de Boulogne,</span> remains a mystery. Because many of the shrubs, flowers, and trees at <span data-click-image-zoomto="6">the Bois</span> and other green spaces were damaged or destroyed during the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune, scant records of their material presence survive today.[^ref5] Making images of nepenthes, such as Lambotte’s, vital records of its past presence in Paris, during the 1860s.

As this example makes clear, images of nepenthes provide insights about tropical pitcher plants and their entanglement with human societies and cultures. A history of nepenthes in pictures focusing on European visual culture, from the 1650s to the 1870s, illuminates how artists used formal means to exoticize, objectify, anthropomorphize, or domesticate this plant. Analysis of eighteenth-century illustrations and herbarium sheets, for example, clarifies how these mediums were enlisted to communicate selected aesthetic, scientific, and commercial information often from a Eurocentric perspective. At the same time, it reveals how such images generally flattened and decontextualized plant specimens to the detriment of apprehending their complex status as life-forms and webs of interaction in the wild.[^ref6] Charting changes in the visual vocabularies used to portray nepenthes in the 1800s also powerfully demonstrates this plant’s far-reaching impact on the realms of horticulture, botany, and indoor gardening.

### Plant Carnivory

Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the world. This group of tropical climbing vines and shrubs developed extraordinary leaf adaptations that compensate for the nutrient-poor soil typical of their native habitat, which ranges from Madagascar and the Seychelles to parts of Southeast Asia and Oceania.[^ref7] _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, for example, evolved wing-shaped leaf bases (petioles) capable of absorbing sunlight to fuel photosynthesis and highly modified cup-like pitchers capable of deriving nutrients from prey and animal feces. Even more remarkably, _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows not one but two types of pitchers (leaf dimorphism): <span data-click-image-zoomto="8">squat terrestrial pitchers</span> catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, and their <span data-click-image-zoomto="10">tapered aerial counterparts</span> trap flying insects and collect bat guano. These leaf adaptations evidence just some of nepenthes’ complex interconnections with other life-forms and physical environments.[^ref8]

Nepenthes fall into the category carnivorous plants because they have adapted mechanisms to attract, trap, kill, digest, and derive nutrients from prey. Most species of nepenthes attract insects and animals to their pitchers through color, nectar, and scent, and these highly modified leaves function as pitfall traps. Oftentimes their nectar contains ingredients that intoxicate or tranquilize prey so that, after fall into a trap, it drowns or dies from exhaustion or starvation. The prey is then digested with the help of enzymes secreted or synthesized by the plant. While nepenthes’ carnivory is well known to plant enthusiasts today, that was not always so. The function of its pitchers in the wild was once a botanical mystery that enthralled Europeans for some 200 years since this plant was first recorded by Westerners in the 1650s. For this reason, nepenthes’ pitchers became an enduring source of fascination and a locus of meaning in Euro-inflected images of this plant for more than two centuries.

### “A Small Vase, with Its Own Lid, a Wonderful Sight”

Images and dried specimens of nepenthes along with textual descriptions of this plant were slow to reach Europe from the mid-1600s through the 1700s. During this period, only three _Nepenthes_ species of the more than [160 accepted today](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:327014-2) were recorded by Europeans.[^ref5] The slow pace of identifications was partly due to the labor, time, and cost involved in finding and describing foreign flora in the tropics for publication in Europe and partly due to the limited range of some species to an isolated geographic region. While the greatest species diversity is concentrated in the Philippines, Borneo, and Sumatra, the earliest recorded colonial encounters occurred in other places in which there was only one or two endemic species present.

A constellation of European encounters with nepenthes the second half of the 1600s included those of the French colonial governor of Madagascar  Étienne de Flacourt with _Nepenthes madagascariensis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="-19.851956606106267, 47.10416219453961, 6">Madagascar,</span> the Dutch-Polish merchant and botanist Jacob Breyne with _Nepenthes distillatoria_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="7.285398878746777, 80.64775966499727, 6">Sri Lanka,</span> and the Portuguese Jesuit missionary and botanist João de Loureiro with _Nepenthes mirabilis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="16.250907711663363, 102.3281993917686, 5.5">Vietnam.</span>[^ref6] They traveled to the southern tropics under the aegis of colonial trading companies and rulers, recording findings about native flora for botanical publications. While such studies often relied on the assistance of indigenous peoples to locate and describe plants, European assessments of local knowledge must be interpreted with a healthy dose of skepticism because they tended to omit, misconstrue, or diminished information to accommodate a Eurocentric world view.

The cultural importance that Europeans attached to nepenthes’ pitchers was first evidenced in Étienne de Flacourt’s [_Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar_](https://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.do?id=406802) of 1658.[^ref7] This book contains the earliest known picture and description of a tropical pitcher plant: _Nepenthes madagascariensis_. Its plant chart shows a tiny nepenthes (number 43) reduced to a pitcher with a once-coiled tendril and several leaf blades. By emphasizing these botanical parts, the image implies that they excited wonder and were presumed valuable to humans. Flacourt’s description of nepenthes also focused on its pitcher: “a hollow flower or fruit resembling a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight.”[^ref8] His expression of astonishment upon encountering a pitcher—that not only defied European expectations about botanical structures, but also resisted efforts to be categorized as a leaf, flower, or fruit—would be echoed many times over.

### “Its Pitchers Are Kept with Other Strange Things”

A similar fascination with nepenthes’ pitchers is evidenced in the pages of the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius’s  [_Herbarium Amboinense_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10702) from 1741–53.[^ref9] Rumphius conducted research for his book while working as a merchant for the Dutch East India Company on Ambon Island—then part of Dutch-controlled Indonesia.[^ref10] His herbal contains descriptions of two ‘_Cantherifera_’ (tankard bearers)—probably _Nepenthes mirabilis_ and _Nepenthes maxima_—that provide important information about these plants’ appearance, names, habitat, and use.[^ref11] Of greatest interest here is Rumphius’s declaration that nepenthes “serves mostly as a curiosity, and its pitchers are kept with other strange things.”[^ref12] This explanation of nepenthes’ primary use—as an object of wonder—distinguished it from many of the era’s most-prized economic plants, which Dutch merchants sold as medicines, foods, and spices, such as [cinnamon.](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/cinnamon/) This cultural valuation of nepenthes’ pitchers also exemplified an anthropocentric perspective on the world that instrumentalized plants.

Rumphius’s _Herbarium Amboinense_ contains an unsigned portrait of nepenthes shown alongside another plant: _Flagellaria_.[^ref13] It demonstrates some visual conventions for representing plants in the late 1600s and early 1700s. They include depicting a plant at full-length, positioning botanical parts laterally flattened, and showing specimens against a plain background. These visual strategies were endorsed by a culture of research that privileged optical clarity above other priorities. Omitted from the frame of representation was crucial site-specific information about a plant’s habitat and web of interactions with other life-forms.

Another convention of the era’s botanical illustrations and herbarium specimens was showing plants with inflorescences to communicate information about their lifecycle (physiology). In this case, the image shows the presence of <span data-click-image-zoomto="14">staminate</span> (male) flowers on two plants and pistillate (female) flowers that developed <span data-click-image-zoomto="15">seed pods</span> on the third.[^ref14] While this aspect of the illustration is inaccurate because nepenthes are dioecious, meaning male plants do not grow offshoots with female clones, this mistake or deliberate pastiche detracted little from the image’s main function to aid in plant identification and highlight precious botanical materials.

### Nepenthes: Generic Name and Mythical Drug

Even the generic name Nepenthes exemplifies an enchantment with tropical pitcher plants. The illustrious Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus chose the name nepenthes, from the Greek  [νηπενθές](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=nhpenqh/s) (without grief), in the late 1730s.[^ref15] His doing so analogized the plant to a mythical drug described in Homer’s _Odyssey_.[^ref16] In a scene from Book IV, Helen of Troy offers a vessel of wine mixed with _nepenthe_ to her husband Menelaus, who has returned from the Trojan War, to induce a pleasant state of forgetfulness.[^ref17] On this episode’s relationship to the plant, Linnaeus wrote, “If this is not Helen’s _Nepenthes_, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator.”[^ref18] Linnaeus here compares his botanical encounter with nepenthes to the experience of Menelaus in thrall to the potent drug nepenthe, leaving no doubt about this plant’s viscerally evocative presence and its intoxicating effect on humans.

Linnaeus wrote this description for his 1738 book [_Hortus Cliffortianus_](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11198) while living in the Netherlands.[^ref19] This botanical catalogue was commissioned from him by the wealthy Anglo-Dutch banker George Clifford III, who was a director of the Dutch East India Company, to document his magnificent live and dried plant collections at Hartekamp, outside Haarlem.[^ref20] Although _Hortus Cliffortianus_ does not contain any portraits of nepenthes, the specimen upon which Linnaeus based his description may still survive in the [Clifford Herbarium.](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/botanical-collections/clifford-herbarium/) The dried plant is adhered to a support bearing a <span data-click-image-zoomto="28,1781,568,528">printed cartouche label</span> with the name _Nepenthes distillatoria_ and an example of the <span data-click-image-zoomto="377,1708,568,528">printed decorative urns</span> used as mounts throughout Clifford’s collection.[^ref21] The <span data-click-image-zoomto="-103,101,1528,1421">plant’s pressed petiole,</span> lamina, tendril, and (now partly preserved) pitchers gave botanists intimate access to and evidentiary proof of nepenthes not otherwise attainable without traveling to the southern tropics. Yet this medium flattened nepenthes into a cultural system of representation that desiccated, decontextualized, and aestheticized plants, making it difficult to study a pitcher’s form and (nearly) impossible to intuit its function in the wild.[^ref22]

### The Art of Botanical and Horticultural Networks

Nepenthes’ imagery dramatically changed in the early 1800s following the emergence of a new genre—illustrated botanical and horticultural journals—in England in the late 1700s. These well-illustrated publications were generally produced by botanists, horticulturalists, and nursery owners for scientists, amateur gardeners, collectors, and plant enthusiasts. A readership hungry for information about newly introduced exotics and instructions for cultivating them. The first image of a nepenthes cultivated in Europe was published in the Loddiges nursery catalogue [_The Botanical Cabinet_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/29220781#page/36/mode/1up) of 1825.[^ref23] This hand-colored plate showing _Nepenthes khasiana_ (then incorrectly identified as _Nepenthes distillatoria_) dispensed with many conventions of eighteenth-century illustrations and herbarium sheets to prioritize aesthetic concerns. A close-up view of a lidded pitcher overlapping an inflorescence with pistillate flowers focuses attention on this plant’s most alluring and ornamental parts.

Some of the most prominent botanical and horticultural journals to advertise nepenthes were established in England beginning in the late 1700s. They included William Curtis’s [_The Botanical Magazine_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/7351#page/2/mode/1up) (succeeded by [_Curtis’s Botanical Magazine_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14276#page/2/mode/1up)), Conrad Loddiges’ [_The Botanical Cabinet_,](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/91698#page/1/mode/1up) and Joseph Paxton and his cofounders’ [_The Gardeners’ Chronicle_.](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95187#page/1/mode/1up)[^ref24] While British nurseries initially dominated global plants trades, this monopoly was broken by the Belgian firms of Louis van Houtte, Ambroise Verschaffelt, and Jean Jules Linden in the 1840s and 1850s.[^ref25] Van Houtte’s [_Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l’Europe_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53599#page/3/mode/1up) and Vershaffelt’s [_L’Illustration horticole_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/3350#page/3/mode/1up) (later acquired by Linden) also ran advertisements for nepenthes.[^ref26] A survey of their pages reveals an intense rivalry—each nursery strove for exclusive proprietorship over the newest, rarest, and most luxurious stock.

By the 1850s and 1860s, new technologies increased access to nepenthes in Europe and promoted a fashion for this plant’s use as an ornamental. Faster modes of land and maritime travel enabled the first shipment of a live pitcher plant to Europe in the 1840s.[^ref30]  Shortly thereafter, the British botanist Nathaniel Ward invented a [glazed box](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/botany-of-empire/plant-transportation/on-the-growth-of-plants-in-closely-glazed-cases)—the Wardian case—in which live plants could be shipped safely overseas.[^ref31] Its adoption by many nurseries in the 1840s accelerated the flow of pitcher plants to Europe, where they were cultivated in glasshouses that were themselves products of innovations in manufacturing, construction, and engineering. this chromolithograph was published as part of a set in the French engineer Adolphe Alphand’s [_Les Promenades de Paris_.](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i)[^ref33] The double-volume folio, from 1868–73, commemorated a citywide urban renewal project initiated by Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, overseen by Georges-Eugène Haussmann, and realized by many architects, horticulturalists, gardeners, and engineers, including Alphand.[^ref34] The publication was displayed at numerous world’s fairs to show France’s excellence in horticulture and garden design and ability to competitive with Britain in these arenas.[^ref35]

### Gimme Danger

Although Western botanists had long observed insects, animals, and liquid inside nepenthes’ pitchers, the reason why was not known until the British scientist Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker published his research on plant carnivory in the mid-1870s.[^ref42] Prior to this period, it was assumed that fauna fell into open pitchers by accident. Hooker, a friend and colleague of the British scientist Charles Darwin, author of the 1859 book [Origin of Species,](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42663068) realized that the form of nepenthes’ pitchers evolved to attract, trap, kill, digest, and derive nutrients from prey.[^ref43] Hooker’s 1874 lecture on this research and his colleagues’ related findings was covered in scientific and mainstream journals published internationally. They featured dazzling images of nepenthes in which artists invented a new visual vocabulary to communicate this plant’s deadly interactions with insects. An illustration from a French journal, for instance, shows a bee and fly near the peristome of an open-lidded pitcher and an earwig crushed by another’s closed lid. This image incorrectly suggests that pitcher lids snap shut to capture prey, like a Venus flytrap’s leaves, though they are actually pitfall traps.[^ref43]

### “Exotic Plants and Flowers” Sold Here

While it is difficult to determine how many amateur gardeners and plant collectors grew nepenthes, sources indicate that it was sold by the Belgian Linden nursery in early Third Republic Paris. The commercial availability of nepenthes was celebrated in a story and print announcing the grand opening of Linden’s Parisian branch in 1879.[^ref38] This picture, which was designed by the French artist Èdouard Riou, invited one to inhabit the role of a pedestrian-shopper standing before Linden’s boutique on the rue de la Paix. The store’s steam-streaked windows frame a panoramic view of untold botanical riches from New Caledonia, India, Oceania, and South America. Inside the <span data-click-image-zoomto="511,1156,1068,985">showroom,</span> one found a vast array of rare, foreign, and luxurious plants, including carnivores. Two plant portraits, in the image’s bottom register, advertise the <span data-click-image-zoomto="1117,2018,890,821">carnivores</span> _Darlingtonia californica_ kept under a bell jar and <span data-click-image-zoomto="123,1897,890,821">nepenthes</span> suspended in a hanging container. What would Parisians have made of this sort of tropical pitcher plant?

Linden’s marketing of nepenthes as “exotic”—both in the botanical sense and culturally—invites consideration of what associations this plant and its foreign provenance may have held for late nineteenth-century plant enthusiasts.[^ref39] Regardless of whether the nursery’s nepenthes came from India, Oceania, or New Caledonia, it boasted of trafficking in flora from these places and that was perhaps enough to conflate tropical pitcher plants with an imagined Orient that flattened botanical, cultural, and ecological differences.[^ref40] Because there was not any convention for portraying nepenthes in its native habitat, travel pictures of New Caledonia offer some clues about what stereotypes of this colony were then in circulation.[^ref41] A view of the Port-de-France presents a paradisical landscape seen from an elevated vantage point that reinforced a European position of mastery over this site and its botanical riches. Similarly, a portrait of the Frenchman and miner Jules Gardier shows him reclining, like an odalisque, in a lush green space with persons of Kanak heritage. These images of colonial contact zones offer some suggestions about the kinds of Eurocentric fantasies that may have become associated with exotic plants.

### Enduring Wonderment

Scientists have also discovered that many nepenthes engage in symbiotic relationships with animals from which they also derive nutrients. In the case of _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ variety elongate, the plant’s hollow leaves serve as a toilet for _Kerivoula hardwickii_, commonly known as Hardwicke’s wooly bat. This plant’s pitchers co-evolved with bats in amazing ways. The color and shape of the pitcher allow bats identify it from among others in the same habitat through echolocation. In other words, its lid possesses a uniquely concave surface that pings just right for the bats. The pitchers are also shaped such that they allow bats to roost inside without risking falling into the hollowed space or coming into contact with its fluid. While the bat is protected from the elements and predators, it leaves a “present” behind: guano. Rich in nitrogen and phosphates, this feces provides the sorts of nutrients that are found lacking in _Nepenthes rafflesiana_’s native habitat, in Borneo. Remarkably, the poop of wooly bats, which are insectivorous, boasts a higher concentration of nutrients than do insects endemic to the region.

The contemporary artists Madeline von Foerster produces dazzling pictures of plants that engage with present-day environmental issues. In her painting _Carnival Insectivora_, Foerster represents a bouquet of vividly hued carnivores that visually conveys their visceral and aesthetic allure. At the center of the composition, an open-lidded nepenthes—mouth agape and no doubt hungry—waits to be fed a jewel-like insect clasped within the fingers of a disembodied hand. The plant is displayed alongside a verity of other equally charismatic carnivores. They include, moving clockwise from bottom left, _Drosera_ (sundew), _Heliamphora_ (sun pitcher), _Darlingtonia_ (cobra plant), _Sarracenia_ (American pitcher plant), _Drosophyllum_ (dewy pine), and _Dionaea muscipula_ (Venus flytrap). The diversity of genii showcased in this image recall the sorts of illustrations that were produced in the mid-1870s, celebrating the discovery of plant carnivory.

[^ref26]: Records indicate that the prominent English botanist Sir Joseph Banks introduced nepenthes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as early as 1789, though the plant probably perished soon thereafter.

[^ref28]: In the early 1800s, a man named Dr. Carey likely transported seeds of Nepenthes khasiana from its limited habitat—Bengal’s Khasia and Jainta Hills—to England. Mysteriously enough, little mention of nepenthes was made in the realm of horticulture for the next twenty years. Perhaps it proved too difficult for the Loddiges nursery to keep its tropical pitcher plant alive in cultivation.
