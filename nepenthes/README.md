Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the natural world. This group of tropical climbing vines and epiphytes developed extraordinary leaf adaptations that compensate for the nutrient-poor soil typical of its native habitat, ranging from Madagascar to Southeast Asia and Oceania.[^ref1] _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, for example, evolved wing-shaped petioles capable of absorbing sunlight to fuel the synthesis of glucose (photosynthesis) and highly modified pitcher-like leaves capable of deriving nutrients from prey and animal feces. More remarkable still, as _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows, it develops not one but two types of pitchers (leaf dimorphism) that have different forms and functions. While <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">squat low-lying pitchers</span> catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">tapered aerial pitchers</span> trap flying insects and collect bat guano. <span data-click-image-zoomto="3">These traits</span> along with the plant’s leathery green wings, mottled purple-and-maroon leaf markings, and extravagant curlicue tendrils have also captivated human imaginations.[^ref2]

Yet, for more than 200 years after the first documented European encounter with nepenthes, in the late 1650s, the vital role of this plant’s pitchers in the wild remained an intriguing botanical mystery that enthralled colonial settlers, naturalists, traders, collectors, and artists. The earliest known record of nepenthes was written by the French colonial governor of Madagascar Étienne de Flacourt and published with a small illustration showing this specimen in his 1658 book [_Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar_.](https://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.do?id=406802)[^ref3] Flacourt’s description of _Anramitaco_ (now named _Nepenthes madagascariensis_) expresses his astonishment upon observing its pitcher: “a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight.[^ref4] Mistaking this foreign botanical form for a “flower or fruit,” Flacourt could never have imagined that it was actually a highly-modified leaf, nor dreamed of its specialized function to attract, trap, kill, and digest prey.[^ref5] Such reactions to nepenthes typified European writings of the late 1600s and 1700s, when there was still limited access to this plant because it was too fragile to survive the transoceanic migration to Europe.

The 1840s saw a tremendous increase in plant mobility and, in turn, European access to nepenthes. Expanding colonial trade networks and faster modes of land and maritime travel coupled with the invention of the Wardian case—a [glazed case](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/botany-of-empire/plant-transportation/on-the-growth-of-plants-in-closely-glazed-cases) for shipping live plants—and other technologies brought nepenthes into sustained cultivation in Europe for the first time.[^ref6] A cultural history of nepenthes focused on this transformative moment in human-plant relations illuminates how nineteenth-century artists active in Ghent and Paris contributed to a sudden explosion of interest in pitcher plants and their display in modern urban spaces. Artists of the late 1840s through the 1860s, for example, cultivated a striking visual language for advertising nepenthes to wealthy collectors and celebrated its use in municipal green spaces. Similarly, artists of the mid-1870s developed new conventions for their illustrations of nepenthes that accompanied news of recent discoveries of plant carnivory. By exploring how the images participated in shaping cultural attitudes toward plants in late-nineteenth-century Europe, this visual narrative also considers the relationship of such attitudes to a contemporary problem known as “plant blindness” (hereafter referred to as “plant awareness”) and current efforts to conserve endangered species.[^ref7]

### Nepenthes: Generic Name and Mythical Drug

How to describe, in a word, a type of plant with mesmerizing leaves resembling lidded pitchers? This question no doubt occupied the illustrious Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the mid-1730s, when he first encountered a tropical pitcher plant that he wished to document in his forthcoming book [_Hortus Cliffortianus_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11198) from 1838.[^ref8] Inspired by this specimen’s pitchers and an episode from Homer’s _Odyssey_, Linnaeas named the genus Nepenthes from the Greek [νηπενθές](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=nhpenqh/s) (without sorrow).[^ref9] Analogizing the plant and Homer’s poem, Linnaeus wrote, “If this is not Helen’s _Nepenthes_, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator.”[^ref10] Linnaeus here compares his first botanical encounter with nepenthes to the experience of being in thrall to a powerful drug: nepenthe. In the _Odyssey_, nepenthe mixed with wine is offered by Helen of Troy to her husband Menelaus, after his return from war, to induce a pleasant state of forgetfulness.[^ref11] Similarly, Linnaeus found unexpected pleasure in contemplating a cup (leaf) filled with contents (digestive fluids) unknown to him.[^ref12]

By invoking the travel-worn Menelaus in his description of Nepenthes, Linnaeus perhaps also alludes to the circumstances surrounding his own encounter with nepenthes. To study the specimen that he documented in _Hortus Cliffortianus_, Linnaeus had to travel from Sweden to the Netherlands. Between 1736 and 1738, he worked for the wealthy Anglo-Dutch banker George Clifford III at his estate Hartekamp, outside Haarlem, documenting the contents of Clifford’s renowned plant collection and garden.[^ref13] Clifford, who was a Director of the Dutch East India Company, surely leveraged his ties with colonial traders to obtain rare exotic plants for his collection, including nepenthes. He was also part of an active network of collectors who exchanged plant materials and dried specimens.

Remarkably, the plant that Linnaeus recorded (now known as _Nepenthes distillatoria_) may still survive today as a dried specimen in the [Clifford Herbarium.](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/botanical-collections/clifford-herbarium/) Describe the specimen in detail. Add a sentence about the significance of herbariums and herbarium specimens during the period of European colonial expansion.[^ref14] Add a sentence about the materiality of the object and the aesthetics of flatness and the flattening of knowledge about plants.[^ref15] While Linnaeus enjoyed the privilege of direct access to nepenthes in Europe, other naturalists of the late 1600s and 1700s studied the plant after making long, perilous journeys to the tropics of South East Asia and Oceana—then a crucible of European colonialism.

Between the late 1650s and the 1700s, only three species of nepenthes were recorded by Europeans who traveled under the aegis of colonial trading companies and rulers.[^ref16] This constellation of colonial encounters with nepenthes included those of the French colonial governor Étienne de Flacourt with _Nepenthes madagascariensis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="-19.851956606106267, 47.10416219453961">Madagascar,</span> the Dutch merchant and botanist Jacob Breyn with _Nepenthes distillatoria_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="7.285398878746777, 80.64775966499727">Sri Lanka,</span> and the Portuguese Jesuit missionary and botanist João de Loureiro with _Nepenthes mirabilis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="16.250907711663363, 102.3281993917686">Vietnam.</span>[^ref17] The small number of species known to Europeans during this period can be explained by the fact that some species are endemic to a limited area. _Nepenthes madagascariensis_, for example, only occurs in Madagascar and the same is true of _Nepenthes distillatoria_ in Sri Lanka. The slow trickle of information about nepenthes back to Europe can also be attributed to its great distance from this plant’s native range as well as the enormous amount of work required for studying live plants, documenting research in images and text, and transporting manuscripts overseas for publication.

The difficulties involved in disseminating botanical knowledge are dramatically exemplified by the tumultuous life of the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius.[^ref18] In the mid-1650s, Rumphius enlisted in the Dutch East India Company and sailed for the Ambon archipelago then part of Dutch-controlled Indonesia. Rumphius rose to the rank of merchant and began an ambitious study of the region’s flora and fauna. In the 1660s, he authored a description of nepenthes that he named _Cantherifera_ (tankard-bearer) for his book [_Herbarium Amboinense_.](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10702)[^ref19] Naming rights to the genus _Nepenthes_, however, went to Carl Linnaeus because Rumphius’ treatise was not published until 1741, postdating Linnaeus’s naming and description of the genus.[^ref20] The delay in publishing _Herbarium Amboinense_ is due to the nearly completed book being destroyed by fire in 1687. While Rumphius doggedly rewrote the manuscript despite loosing his eyesight to glaucoma, the original copy of this version was lost at sea in 1692. When another copy finally reached the <span data-click-map-flyto="52.07034238316786, 5.574769961028949">Netherlands,</span> its publication was again delayed by the Dutch East India Company that wanted to guard its monopoly over botanical information.

There is some uncertainty about when nepenthes first entered cultivation in Europe. Records indicate that the prominent English botanist Sir Joseph Banks introduced nepenthes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as early as 1789, though the plant probably perished soon thereafter.[^ref21] In the early 1800s, a man named Dr. Carey likely transported seeds of Nepenthes khasiana from its limited habitat—Bengal’s Khasia and Jainta Hills—to England.[^ref22] What is definitively known is that the Loddiges family nursery of London was the first to advertise a cultivated pitcher plant. The notice and illustration promoting Nepenthes distillatoria (actually Nepenthes khasiana) appeared in _Curtis’s Botanical Magazine_, in 1825.[^ref23] Yet for the next twenty-some years, even as botanists identified nearly ten new species, the horticultural trades remained largely silent about nepenthes. Things dramatically changed in the 1840s with the shipping of the first live pitcher plant to Europe and the embrace of the Wardian case, after which a huge influx of nepenthes reached European nurseries and its likeness soon became a fixture of horticultural journals.

### The Art of Horticultural Networks

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.

Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.
