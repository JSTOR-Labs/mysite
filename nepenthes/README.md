Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the world. This group of tropical climbing vines, shrubs, and epiphytes developed extraordinary leaf adaptations that compensate for the nutrient-poor soil typical of their native habitat, which ranges from Madagascar and the Seychelles to Southeast Asia and Oceania.[^ref1] _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, for example, evolved wing-shaped petioles capable of absorbing sunlight to fuel the synthesis of glucose (photosynthesis) and highly modified pitcher-like leaves capable of deriving nutrients from prey and animal feces. More remarkable still, as _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows, it develops not one but two types of pitchers (leaf dimorphism) that have different forms and functions. While <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">squat low-lying pitchers</span> catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">tapered aerial pitchers</span> trap flying insects and collect bat guano. Yet, prior to the publication of scientific research on plant carnivory in the mid-1870s, the significance of nepenthes’ pitchers in the wild was a botanical mystery that enthralled European colonial settlers, naturalists, traders, collectors, botanists, and artists for more than 200 years.[^ref2]

Just as mysterious as the form and function of nepenthes’ pitchers was their potential use to humans in domestication. The cultural importance of these mysteries and efforts to resolve them were visually articulated by artists since the earliest European record of nepenthes, from the 1650s. The first image and description of nepenthes were published in the French colonial governor of Madagascar Étienne de Flacourt’s book [_Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar_](https://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.do?id=406802) of 1658.[^ref3] <span data-click-image-zoomto="4">This tiny picture of nepenthes</span> shows only a pitcher, tendril, and winged petiole to emphasize botanical parts that excite wonder and might be in some way useful to humans. A mix of astonishment and puzzlement also characterizes <span data-click-image-zoomto="5">Flacourt’s description of an ‘_Anramitaco_’</span> (now named _Nepenthes madagascariensis_) pitcher: “a hollow flower or fruit resembling a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight.”[^ref4] <span data-click-image-zoomto="6">Mistaking this botanical form</span> for a reproductive organ or seed, Flacourt could never have imagined that it was actually a highly-modified leaf, nor dreamed of its specialized function to attract, trap, kill, and digest prey. The mysteries of nepenthes’ pitchers continued to enthrall Europeans throughout the 1700s as access to the plant remained limited, though things dramatically changed when plant mobility increased in the early 1800s.

A cultural history of nepenthes focused on nineteenth-century Ghent and Paris reveals how artists contributed to a sudden explosion of interest in pitcher plants and their display in modern urban spaces. By the early 1800s, expanding colonial trade networks and faster modes of land and maritime travel coupled with the invention of the Wardian case—a [glazed case](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/botany-of-empire/plant-transportation/on-the-growth-of-plants-in-closely-glazed-cases) for shipping live plants—and other technologies brought nepenthes into sustained cultivation in Europe for the first time.[^ref5] Responding to these remarkable changes, artists of the late 1840s through the 1880s cultivated a striking visual language for representing nepenthes in advertisements and other kinds of plant portraits. Likewise, artists of the mid-1870s developed another set of conventions for portraying nepenthes in journals and newspapers that reported on recent discoveries of plant carnivory. By considering how these images participated in a broader moment of transformation in human-plant relations in the late nineteenth-century, this visual narrative also links shifting cultural attitudes toward vegetal life to the contemporary societal problem known as “plant blindness” and current efforts to conserve endangered species.[^ref6]

### Nepenthes: Generic Name and Mythical Drug

Much like a botanical illustration, the generic name Nepenthes is meant to call to mind a type specimen and its defining morphological characteristics. The illustrious Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus chose the name _Nepenthes_,[^ref7] from the Greek [νηπενθές](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=nhpenqh/s) (without grief), to conjure an image of a tropical pitcher plant by alluding to a wine vessel and mythical drug from Homer’s _Odyssey_.[^ref8] In this scene, Helen of Troy offers wine mixed with _nepenthe_ to her husband Menelaus, after his return from war, to induce a pleasant state of forgetfulness.[^ref9]  On this episode’s relationship to the plant, Linnaeus wrote, “If this is not Helen’s _Nepenthes_, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator.”[^ref10] Linnaeus here compares his first botanical encounter with a tropical pitcher plant to the experience of Menelaus in thrall to the powerful drug _nepenthe_, , leaving no doubt that the botanist was enthralled by its curiously-shaped leaves and whatever secrets they contained.

Linnaeus wrote this description of nepenthes for his 1738 book [_Hortus Cliffortianus_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11198) while living in the Netherlands.[^ref11] It was commissioned by the wealthy Anglo-Dutch banker George Clifford III, who was a Director of the Dutch East India Company, to document his magnificent live and dried plant collections at Hartekamp, outside Haarlem.[^ref12] Although Hortus Cliffortianus does not contain any portraits of nepenthes, the type specimen upon which Linnaeus based his description may still survive in the [Clifford Herbarium.](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/botanical-collections/clifford-herbarium/) This sheet bears a <span data-click-image-zoomto="28,1781,568,528">printed cartouche label</span> with the species name _Nepenthes distillatoria_ and a <span data-click-image-zoomto="377,1708,568,528">printed decorative urn</span> that was applied to all of the specimens owned by Clifford. <span data-click-image-zoomto="-440,84,2200,2047">The plant’s pressed petiole,</span> wire thin tendril, and now only partially preserved pitchers gave eighteenth-century botanists intimate access to nepenthes that was not otherwise possible without traveling to the tropics.[^ref13] Yet, as the art historian Giovanni Aloi observed, this medium flattens plants both materially and theoretically by reducing them to mere images of their former selves—omitting rich information about their color, volume, size, root systems, habitats, and ecologies.[^ref14] Some of these shortcomings are resolved in plant portraits executed in printed media, though nothing, of course, could substitute for sustained engagement with live plants in nature.

Information about nepenthes—both images and text—slowly traveled from the tropics to Europe, from the mid-1600s to the 1700s. Of the roughly 60 nepenthes species accepted today, only three were recorded by Europeans during this period.[^ref15] These types of nepenthes were documented by Europeans traveling under the aegis of colonial trading companies and rulers. This geographic constellation of human-plant encounters includes the French colonial governor the French colonial governor Étienne de Flacourt with _Nepenthes madagascariensis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="-19.851956606106267, 47.10416219453961">Madagascar,</span> the Dutch-Polish merchant and botanist Jacob Breyne with _Nepenthes distillatoria_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="7.285398878746777, 80.64775966499727">Sri Lanka,</span> and the Portuguese Jesuit missionary and botanist João de Loureiro with _Nepenthes mirabilis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="16.250907711663363, 102.3281993917686">Vietnam.</span>[^ref16] These accomplishments notwithstanding, scant information about nepenthes reached Europe due in part to the enormous amount of labor required to produce visual and verbal descriptions of foreign flora as well as the time, money, and other resources needed to transport, reproduce, publish, sell, and distribute such materials.

The difficulties involved in producing a comprehensive treatise on plants native to a specific region are exemplified by the tumultuous history of the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius’s [_Herbarium Amboinense_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10702) from 1741–53.[^ref17] In the mid-1650s, Rumphius enlisted in the Dutch East India Company and sailed for the Ambon archipelago then part of Dutch-controlled Indonesia. After rising to the rank of merchant, he began an ambitious study of the region’s flora that included a description of ‘_Cantherifera_’ (tankard-bearer) now known as _Nepenthes mirabilis_.[^ref18] Because the first volume of Rumphius’s _Herbarium Amboinense_ was not published until 1741, two decades after the author’s death, naming rights to _Nepenthes_ went to Carl Linnaeus.[^ref19] The delay in publishing _Herbarium Amboinense_ is due to the nearly completed book being destroyed by fire in 1687 and, later, to the original copy of the rewritten version being lost at sea in 1692. When another copy of the manuscript finally reached the <span data-click-map-flyto="52.07034238316786, 5.574769961028949">Netherlands,</span> its publication was again delayed by the Dutch East India Company, which wanted to retain control over botanical knowledge and its economic monopoly over certain plants.

There is some uncertainty about when nepenthes first entered cultivation in Europe. Records indicate that the prominent English botanist Sir Joseph Banks introduced nepenthes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as early as 1789, though the plant probably perished soon thereafter. In the early 1800s, a man named Dr. Carey likely transported seeds of _Nepenthes khasiana_ from its limited habitat—Bengal’s Khasia and Jainta Hills—to England. What is definitively known is that the Loddiges family nursery of London was the first to advertise a cultivated pitcher plant. The notice and illustration promoting Nepenthes distillatoria (actually _Nepenthes khasiana_) appeared in _Curtis’s Botanical Magazine_, in 1825. Yet for the next twenty-some years, even as botanists identified nearly ten new species, the horticultural trades remained largely silent about nepenthes. Things dramatically changed in the 1840s with the shipping of the first live pitcher plant to Europe and the embrace of the Wardian case, after which a huge influx of nepenthes reached European nurseries and its likeness soon became a fixture of horticultural journals.

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.
