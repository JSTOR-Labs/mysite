Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the natural world. This group of tropical climbing vines and small shrubs developed extraordinary leaf adaptations that diversify their diet in order to compensate for the nutrient-poor soil typically found in their native habitats, in Southeast Asia and Oceania.[^ref1] _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, for example, evolved wing-shaped petioles capable of absorbing sunlight to fuel the synthesis of glucose (photosynthesis) and highly modified pitcher-like leaves capable of deriving nutrients from prey and animal feces. More remarkable still, as _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows, it develops not one but two types of pitchers (leaf dimorphism) that have different forms and functions. While squat low-lying pitchers catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, tapered aerial pitchers trap flying insects and collect bat guano. These traits along with the plant’s visceral appeal also captivate humans.[^ref2]

Yet, for more than 200 years after the first documented European encounter with nepenthes, in the late 1650s, the vital role of this plant’s pitchers in the wild remained an intriguing botanical mystery that enthralled colonial settlers, naturalists, traders, collectors, and artists. The earliest known record of nepenthes was written by the French colonial governor of Madagascar Étienne de Flacourt and published with a small illustration showing this specimen in his book [_Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar_,](https://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.do?id=406802) from 1658.[^ref3] Flacourt’s description of Anramitaco (now named Nepenthes madagascariensis) expresses his astonishment upon observing its curious pitcher: “a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight.”[^ref4] Mistaking this foreign botanical form for a “flower or fruit,” Flacourt could never have imagined that it was actually a highly-modified leaf, nor dreamed of its specialized function to attract, trap, kill, and digest prey.[^ref5] Such reactions to live nepenthes typifying European accounts of the late 1600s and 1700s were restricted to this plant’s native range because it was too fragile to survive the transoceanic migration to Europe.

The 1840s, however, saw a tremendous increase in plant mobility and, in turn, European access to nepenthes. Expanding colonial trade networks and faster modes of land and maritime travel coupled with the invention of the Wardian case—a sealed box for shipping live plants—and related technologies brought the tropical vine and shrub into cultivation in Europe for the first time ever.[^ref6] A cultural history of nepenthes focused on this exciting moment in human-plant interactions illuminates how nineteenth-century designers, lithographers, and printmakers active in Ghent and Paris contributed to a sudden explosion of interest in pitcher plants and their display in modern urban spaces, especially ones wrought of iron and glass. Artists of the 1850s and 1860s, for example, cultivated a visual language for advertising nepenthes to wealthy collectors and at the same time celebrated its municipal breeding and use as an exotic ornamental in public green spaces.[^ref7] Interpolating these horticultural conventions, which primarily emphasized nepenthes’ shape, color, and markings, artists of the mid-1870s developed a botanical aesthetic of wonder in their illustrations accompanying reports on groundbreaking discoveries of plant carnivory.[^ref8] By exploring the participation of these images in shaping cultural attitudes toward plants in the late nineteenth-century, this visual narrative also connects such attitudes to plant inattentiveness and its impact on current efforts to conserve endangered species.

How to describe, in a word, a type of plant with mesmerizing leaves resembling lidded pitchers? This question no doubt occupied the illustrious Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the mid-1730s, when he first encountered a tropical pitcher plant then lacking a formal scientific name and that he wished to document in his book [_Hortus Cliffortianus_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11198) from 1837. Inspired by this specimen’s peculiar pitchers and an episode from Homer’s _Odyssey_, Linnaeas named the genus Nepenthes from the Greek νηπενθές (without grief). In his analogy between the plant and Homer’s poem, Linnaeus wrote, “If this is not Helen’s _Nepenthes_, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator.”[^ref9] Recollecting his first botanical encounter with nepenthes, Linnaeus here compares it to the experience of being in thrall to a powerful drug: nepenthe. In the _Odyssey_, nepenthe mixed with wine is offered by Helen of Troy to her husband Menelaus, after his return from war, to induce a pleasant state of forgetfulness.[^ref10] Similarly, Linnaeus found unexpected pleasure in contemplating a cup (leaf) filled with contents (digestive fluids) unknown to him.

By invoking the travel-worn Menelaus in his description of Nepenthes, Linnaeus perhaps also alludes to the circumstances surrounding his own encounter with nepenthes. To study the specimen that he documented in _Hortus Cliffortianus_, Linnaeus had to travel from Sweden to the Netherlands. Between 1736 and 1738, he worked for the wealthy Anglo-Dutch banker George Clifford III at his estate Hartekamp, outside Haarlem, documenting the contents of Clifford’s renowned plant collection and garden. Clifford, who was one of the directors of the Dutch East India Company, surely leveraged his ties with colonial traders to obtain his collection of exotic plants including nepenthes. Remarkably, the plant that Linnaeus recorded (now known as _Nepenthes distillatoria_) may still survive today as a dried specimen in the [Clifford Herbarium.](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/botanical-collections/clifford-herbarium/) While Linnaeus enjoyed the privilege of direct access to nepenthes in Europe, most naturalists of his day who studied the plant did so after making long, perilous journeys to the tropics that were funded to advance colonial expansion and bioprospecting enterprises.

### Colonial Bioprospecting and Transoceanic Migration

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.
