Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the world. This group of tropical climbing vines and shrubs developed extraordinary leaf adaptations that compensate for the nutrient-poor soil typical of their native habitat, which ranges from Madagascar and the Seychelles to parts of Southeast Asia and Oceania.[^ref1] _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, for example, evolved wing-shaped leaf bases (petioles) capable of absorbing sunlight to fuel photosynthesis and highly modified cup-like pitchers capable of deriving nutrients from prey and animal feces. Even more remarkably, _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows not one but two types of pitchers (leaf dimorphism): <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">squat terrestrial pitchers</span> catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, and their <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">tapered aerial counterparts</span> trap flying insects and collect bat guano. These leaf adaptations evidence just some of nepenthes’ complex interconnections with other life-forms and physical environments.[^ref2]

Yet the significance of nepenthes’ pitchers in the wild was a botanical mystery that enthralled European colonial settlers, naturalists, traders, collectors, scientists, and artists since this plant was first recorded by Westerners in the 1650s.[^ref3] Such encounters in colonial contact zones provoked Europeans to ask many questions: What kind of botanical structure is a pitcher? Why does its form resemble a domestic drinking vessel? What secrets may be contained inside its hollow body? What is its use and value for humans? Because answers to these queries were not forthcoming, nepenthes’ pitchers became an enduring source of fascination and a locus of meaning in images of this plant, from the 1700s through most of the 1800s.

A history of nepenthes focused on European visual cultures of botanical research and horticultural commerce illuminates some conventions used to represent this plant and its pitchers, from the 1650s to the 1870s. Close visual analysis of eighteenth-century illustrations and herbarium sheets, for example, clarifies how these mediums communicated rich aesthetic and scientific information. At the same, it reveals how such images often flattened and decontextualized plants, which, in the case of nepenthes, hindered efforts to learn about the complexities of its pitchers in the wild.[^ref4] Charting changes in the visual vocabularies used to portray nepenthes in the nineteenth century also powerfully demonstrates this plant’s far-reaching impact on the realms of horticulture, indoor gardening, and botany. Nepenthes’ pitchers—a perennial font of wonder—still inspire scientists, conservationists, and artists today.

Images and dried specimens of nepenthes along with textual descriptions of this plant were slow to reach Europe from the mid-1600s through the 1700s. During this period, only three Nepenthes species of the more than [160 accepted today](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:327014-2) were recorded by Europeans.[^ref5]  The slow pace of new identifications was partly due to the labor and cost of producing records of foreign flora in the tropics and their publication in Europe. It was also due to the limited range of some species to a single mountain or island, such as Nepenthes vieillardi to New Caledonia and Nepenthes distillatoria to Sri Lanka. The greatest species diversity is concentrated in the Philippines (59), Borneo (40), and Sumatra (37), though the earliest recorded colonial encounters occurred in other places.

While such studies often relied on the assistance of indigenous peoples, European accounts often omit, misconstrue, or incorrectly reported local knowledge of native plants making it difficult for scholars to study knowledge exchanges in colonial contact zones.

The cultural importance that Europeans attached to nepenthes’ pitchers was first articulated by artists in the 1650s. The earliest known picture and description of a tropical pitcher plant (_Nepenthes madagascariensis_) were published in the French colonial governor of Madagascar Étienne de Flacourt’s [_Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar_](https://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.do?id=406802) of 1658.[^ref7] In this chart showing tiny plants, nepenthes (number 43) is reduced to a pitcher with a once-coiled tendril and several leaf blades. By emphasizing these botanical parts, the image implies that they excited the most wonder and were of greatest value to humans. Similarly, Flacourt’s description of nepenthes focused on its pitcher: “a hollow flower or fruit resembling a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight.”[^ref8] Flacourt’s expression of astonishment upon encountering a pitcher—that not only defied European expectations about botanical structures, but also resisted efforts to be categorized as a leaf, flower, or fruit—left Europeans hungry for more information about this botanical wonder.

An enduring fascination with nepenthes’ pitchers is evidenced in the pages of the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius’s  [_Herbarium Amboinense_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10702) from 1741–53.[^ref9] Rumphius conducted the research for his book while working as a merchant for the Dutch East India Company on Ambon Island—then part of Dutch-controlled Indonesia.[^ref10] His herbal contains a description of two ‘Cantherifera’ (tankard bearers)—probably _Nepenthes mirabilis_ and _Nepenthes maxima_—that provides important botanical information about these plants’ appearance, names, habitat, and use.[^ref11] Of greatest interest here is Rumphius’s declaration that nepenthes “serves mostly as a curiosity, and its pitchers are kept with other strange things.”[^ref12] This explanation of nepenthes’ primary use—as an object of wonder—distinguished it from many of the era’s most-prized economic plants, which Dutch merchants sold as medicines, foods, and spices, such as [cinnamon](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/cinnamon/). This cultural valuation of nepenthes’ pitchers also exemplifies an anthropocentric perspective on the world that instrumentalized plants.

Even the generic name Nepenthes exemplifies a perennial fascination with tropical pitcher plants. The illustrious Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus chose the name nepenthes, from the Greek  [νηπενθές](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=nhpenqh/s) (without grief), in the late 1730s.[^ref15] His doing so analogized the plant to a mythical drug described in Homer’s _Odyssey_.[^ref16] In a scene from Book IV, Helen of Troy offers a vessel of wine mixed with _nepenthe_ to her husband Menelaus, who has returned from the Trojan War, to induce a pleasant state of forgetfulness.[^ref17] On this episode’s relationship to the plant, Linnaeus wrote, “If this is not Helen’s _Nepenthes_, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator.”[^ref18] Linnaeus here compares his botanical encounter with nepenthes to the experience of Menelaus in thrall to the potent drug nepenthe, leaving no doubt about this plant’s viscerally evocative presence and its intoxicating effect on humans.

Linnaeus wrote this description for his 1738 book [_Hortus Cliffortianus_](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11198) while living in the Netherlands.[^ref19] This botanical catalogue was commissioned from him by the wealthy Anglo-Dutch banker George Clifford III, who was a director of the Dutch East India Company, to document his magnificent live and dried plant collections at Hartekamp, outside Haarlem.[^ref20] Although _Hortus Cliffortianus_ does not contain any portraits of nepenthes, the specimen upon which Linnaeus based his description may still survive in the [Clifford Herbarium.](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/botanical-collections/clifford-herbarium/) The dried plant is mounted on a support bearing a <span data-click-image-zoomto="28,1781,568,528">printed cartouche label</span> with the name _Nepenthes distillatoria_ and an example of the <span data-click-image-zoomto="377,1708,568,528">printed decorative urns</span> used as mounts throughout Clifford’s collection.[^ref21] The <span data-click-image-zoomto="-103,101,1528,1421">plant’s pressed petiole,</span> lamina, tendril, and (now partly preserved) pitchers gave botanists intimate access to and evidentiary proof of nepenthes not otherwise attainable without traveling to the southern tropics.

Because nepenthes’ native range overlapped geographically with European colonial expansion, transregional horticultural networks were able to leverage asymmetrical power relations to exploitatively harvest this plant and cultivate it in major European cities. British nurseries initially dominated ornamental plants trades of the late 1700s and early 1800s, establishing some of the earliest and most prominent horticultural journals of the day. They included Curtis Botanical Journal, Loddiges What, and Paxton Gardeners’ Chronicle.[^ref23] Soon the Belgian firms of Louise van Houtte and Ambroise Verschaffelt each launched their own Ghent-based publications, Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l’Europe and L’Illustration horticole, respectively, that forged collaborations with the French and broke Britain’s monopoly over the industry.[^ref24] Intense rivalries among the top nurseries, which raced to introduce the newest, rarest, and most luxurious stock, inclduing nepenthes and other plants later known for their carnivory.[^ref25]

A strikingly modern, colorful visual language for portraying nepenthes emerged after this plant’s introduction to Europe, by the early 1800s.[^ref26] Indeed, the first horticultural illustration evidencing this trend was published in the Loddiges nursery catalogue [_The Botanical Cabinet_.](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/29220781#page/36/mode/1up) of 1825.[^ref27] This hand-colored plate showing _Nepenthes khasia_ (then incorrectly identified as _Nepenthes distillatoria_) was engraved by George Cooke after a design by his pupil Thomas Shotter Boys. This hand-colored plate showing a European-cultivated Nepenthes khasiana (then incorrectly identified as Nepenthes distillatoria) was engraved by George Cooke after a design by his pupil Thomas Shotter Boys. Dispensing with many conventions of botanical illustrations and herbarium sheets, such as showing an entire plant optically flattened, Boys’ design embraced a more dynamic collage-like composition. By overlapping a close-up view of a lidded pitcher over an inflorescence with pistillate flowers, the artist focuses attention on the most alluring plant parts and recasts them as objects of wonder. The image advertised nepenthes that were grown from seeds harvested in British Ceylon or India.[^ref28] It also enticed Londoner subscribers to visit Loddiges’ Grand Palm House where they could enjoy the colonial privilege of an intimate encounter with this non-native plant on their native soil.[^ref29]

The curious shape and aesthetic allure of nepenthes is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it makes the plant unique, unforgettable, and attractive to humans—a trait that some ecologists have termed “charisma.” In doing so, they argue that cultural values privilege certain species as more interesting and thus worthy of conserving than others. On the other hand, the appeal of nepenthes makes the plant especially vulnerable to poachers, who illegally harvest species and sell them on the black market. The implications of poaching coupled with habitat loss are borne out in the case of _Nepenthes khasiana_—a pitcher plant whose native range is limited to India’s Garo, Khasi, and Jaintia Hills. This plant is the only nepenthes found in India and experts are racing to save it from extinction; it is currently listed as endangered according to the IUCN Red List. To ensure the long-term protection of plants, scientific, government, and other organizations are partnering with villagers to raise awareness about them and protect biodiversity. Ironically, this type of nepenthes was the first one to be cultivated and sold in Europe, at Loddiges nursery. Perhaps bringing full circle the dangers of overharvesting this plant for its use as an ornamental and the market forces and imbalances of power that permitted it.

By the 1850s and 1860s, new technologies increased access to nepenthes in Europe and promoted a fashion for this plant’s use as an ornamental. Faster modes of land and maritime travel enabled the first shipment of a live pitcher plant to Europe in the 1840s.[^ref30]  Shortly thereafter, the British botanist Nathaniel Ward invented a [glazed box](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/botany-of-empire/plant-transportation/on-the-growth-of-plants-in-closely-glazed-cases)—the Wardian case—in which live plants could be shipped safely overseas.[^ref31] Its adoption by many nurseries in the 1840s accelerated the flow of pitcher plants to Europe, where they were cultivated in glasshouses that were themselves products of innovations in manufacturing, construction, and engineering. At roughly the same time, nurseries enlisted a relatively new image-making technology—[chromolithography](http://museumblog.winterthur.org/2014/01/16/chromolithography-the-art-of-the-stone/)—to advertise their stock. Both efficient and cost effective, chromolithography allowed one to produce an almost limitless number of copies from an original design. Most importantly, the prints showed plants in vivid colors perfectly suited for promoting nepenthes—in this case _Nepenthes rafflesiana_’s vibrant green pitchers with purple speckles.

Unlike horticultural illustrations produced to advertise nursery stock, this luminous portrait of [_Nepenthes hookerii_.](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:603725-1) immortalized a plant that embellished civic gardens in Second Empire Paris.[^ref32] The picture shows a full-length view of a mature plant set against a plain blue-and-gold background to clearly articulate its chandelier-like form. The plant’s contrasting hues are also evidenced in two details: a <span data-click-image-zoomto="1891,2724,1567,1453">green-and-maroon lamina</span> with slightly curled edges and a <span data-click-image-zoomto="4155,3695,1567,1405">pitcher with speckled markings</span> and fringed wings. Printed by the esteemed Ghent-based artist G. Severeyns after a watercolor by the French artist Philippe Lambotte, this chromolithograph was published as part of a set in the French engineer Adolphe Alphand’s [_Les Promenades de Paris_.](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i)[^ref33] The double-volume folio, from 1868–73, commemorated a citywide urban renewal project initiated by Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, overseen by Georges-Eugène Haussmann, and realized by many architects, horticulturalists, gardeners, and engineers, including Alphand.[^ref34] The publication was displayed at numerous world’s fairs to show France’s excellence in horticulture and garden design and ability to competitive with Britain in these arenas.[^ref35]

It is astounding that Alphand’s head gardener Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, a French horticulturalist, selected tropical pitcher plants for display in Paris given its mild climate.[^ref36] Perhaps he did so to show the world that the French were up to the task! Indeed, several architectural drawings from Alphand’s Les Promenades des Paris celebrate the use of a new horticultural infrastructure to accomplish this feat. The images depict a glasshouse designed specifically for cultivating nepenthes and a cutting-edge gas and water heating system used to simulate growing conditions in its native habitat. In the longitudinal section, a modern glass-and-metal enclosure frames a row of nepenthes to show how technological advances were harnessed to domesticate this plant for human use. The structure was one of many comprising the <span data-click-image-zoomto="10">Fleuriste de la Muette</span>: a Parisian civic nursery complex built in 1855 to supply ornamentals for the entire city and some seasonal rotations.[^ref37] Its factory-like <span data-click-image-zoomto="8">multiplication glasshouse</span> suggests that ornamental plants were increasingly construed as mass-producible and infinitely replenishable natural resources—a cultural attitude typical of many Western societies today.

Although Western botanists had long observed insects, animals, and liquid inside nepenthes’ pitchers, the reason why was not known until the British scientist Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker published his research on plant carnivory in the mid-1870s.[^ref42] Prior to this period, it was assumed that fauna fell into open pitchers by accident. Hooker, a friend and colleague of the British scientist Charles Darwin, author of the 1859 book [Origin of Species,](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42663068) realized that the form of nepenthes’ pitchers evolved to attract, trap, kill, digest, and derive nutrients from prey.[^ref43] Hooker’s 1874 lecture on this research and his colleagues’ related findings was covered in scientific and mainstream journals published internationally. They featured dazzling images of nepenthes in which artists invented a new visual vocabulary to communicate this plant’s deadly interactions with insects. An illustration from a French journal, for instance, shows a bee and fly near the peristome of an open-lidded pitcher and an earwig crushed by another’s closed lid. This image incorrectly suggests that pitcher lids snap shut to capture prey, like a Venus flytrap’s leaves, though they are actually pitfall traps.[^ref43]

The alluring color, pattern, shape, and texture of pitchers, which humans found curious and exotic, are part of complex ecologies that exemplify how the natural world has evolved over millennia. In terms of their predator-prey relationships, it is now known that most species of nepenthes attract insects and animals to their pitchers through color, nectar, and scent. Nectar secreting glands are mostly located around a pitcher’s opening and, in some instances, give off a sweet scent that winged insects find irresistible. Once they land on a pitcher, such insects detect the presence of nectar underneath its lid and on the inner edge of its peristome. To reach it, they must position themselves perilously close to the leave’s hollow interior. While color patterns, rough textures, and hairs enable bugs to easily crawl up the side of a pitcher, the interior is smooth so that once an insect loses its balance and slips it cannot escape. Depending on the species, pitchers contain viscous or watery liquid, though it works the same to drown victims. Oftentimes the nectar contains ingredients that intoxicate or tranquilize prey so that when they fall into a trap they drown or die from exhaustion or starvation. The prey is then digested with the help of enzymes secreted or synthesized by the plant—a process further aided by infauna living within pitchers.

While it is difficult to determine how many amateur gardeners and plant collectors grew nepenthes, sources indicate that it was sold by the Belgian Linden nursery in early Third Republic Paris. The commercial availability of nepenthes was celebrated in a story and print announcing the grand opening of Linden’s Parisian branch in 1879.[^ref38] This picture, which was designed by the French artist Èdouard Riou, invited one to inhabit the role of a pedestrian-shopper standing before Linden’s boutique on the rue de la Paix.

Linden’s marketing of nepenthes as “exotic”—both in the botanical sense and culturally—invites consideration of what associations this plant and its foreign provenance may have held for late nineteenth-century plant enthusiasts.[^ref39] Regardless of whether the nursery’s nepenthes came from India, Oceania, or New Caledonia, it boasted of trafficking in flora from these places and that was perhaps enough to conflate tropical pitcher plants with an imagined Orient that flattened botanical, cultural, and ecological differences.[^ref40] Because there was not any convention for portraying nepenthes in its native habitat, travel pictures of New Caledonia offer some clues about what stereotypes of this colony were then in circulation.[^ref41] A view of the Port-de-France presents a paradisical landscape seen from an elevated vantage point that reinforced a European position of mastery over this site and its botanical riches. Similarly, a portrait of the Frenchman and miner Jules Gardier shows him reclining, like an odalisque, in a lush green space with persons of Kanak heritage. These images of colonial contact zones offer some suggestions about the kinds of Eurocentric fantasies that may have become associated with exotic plants.

Scientists have also discovered that many nepenthes engage in symbiotic relationships with animals from which they also derive nutrients. In the case of _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ variety elongate, the plant’s hollow leaves serve as a toilet for _Kerivoula hardwickii_, commonly known as Hardwicke’s wooly bat. This plant’s pitchers co-evolved with bats in amazing ways. The color and shape of the pitcher allow bats identify it from among others in the same habitat through echolocation. In other words, its lid possesses a uniquely concave surface that pings just right for the bats. The pitchers are also shaped such that they allow bats to roost inside without risking falling into the hollowed space or coming into contact with its fluid. While the bat is protected from the elements and predators, it leaves a “present” behind: guano. Rich in nitrogen and phosphates, this feces provides the sorts of nutrients that are found lacking in _Nepenthes rafflesiana_’s native habitat, in Borneo. Remarkably, the poop of wooly bats, which are insectivorous, boasts a higher concentration of nutrients than do insects endemic to the region.

In her painting _Carnival Insectivora_, Foerster represents a bouquet of vividly hued carnivores that visually conveys their visceral and aesthetic allure. At the center of the composition, an open-lidded nepenthes—mouth agape and no doubt hungry—waits to be fed a jewel-like insect clasped within the fingers of a disembodied hand. The plant is displayed alongside a verity of other equally charismatic carnivores. They include, moving clockwise from bottom left, _Drosera_ (sundew), _Heliamphora_ (sun pitcher), _Darlingtonia_ (cobra plant), _Sarracenia_ (American pitcher plant), _Drosophyllum_ (dewy pine), and _Dionaea muscipula_ (Venus flytrap). The diversity of genii showcased in this image recall the sorts of illustrations that were produced in the mid-1870s, celebrating the discovery of plant carnivory.

While Madeline von Foerster uses a refined labor-intensive technique to lay down layers of lights and shadows and then colors, producing richly colored radiant surfaces, her choice of botanical imagery engages with the work of late nineteenth and twentieth century artists. Foerster frames the carnivorous bouquet within an illusionistic box that she precisely describes with a gray on white wood grain pattern. Its shape is suggestive of the cabinet of curiosities that wealthy Europeans used to display their collections of naturalia and artifacts gathered from around the world, reputedly even unicorn horns! Yet, her depiction of this framing device, also references the shadow boxes constructed by the American artists Joseph Cornell. He is known for assembling found objects, such as clay pipes, with fauna and scientific images. Similarly, Foerster also evokes the work of the German scientist-artist Ernst Haeckel whose journal _Kunstformen der Natur_ explored the wonders of the natural world, popularizing a visual language of organic forms, undulating lines, and palpating colors. His imagery explored the otherworldly and strange qualities of plants while also imbuing their forms with animacy. Haeckel, who coined the term ecolorgy.

[^ref9]: Nearly a century elapsed between the book’s initial creation in Ambon in the 1680s, then part of Dutch-controlled Indonesia, and its publication in Amsterdam between 1741 and 1753. Its publication was delayed after the nearly completed book was destroyed by fire in 1687 and, later, after the original copy of the rewritten version was lost at sea in 1692. In the intervening years, Rumphius lost his vision from glaucoma and that slowed his ability to reconstruct the text aided by assistants. Once the full six-volume manuscript reached the Netherlands in 1701, the Dutch East India Company temporarily halted its publication to protect the firm’s trade secrets pertaining to nutmeg and clove.

[^ref28]: In the early 1800s, a man named Dr. Carey likely transported seeds of Nepenthes khasiana from its limited habitat—Bengal’s Khasia and Jainta Hills—to England. Mysteriously enough, little mention of nepenthes was made in the realm of horticulture for the next twenty years. Perhaps it proved too difficult for the Loddiges nursery to keep its tropical pitcher plant alive in cultivation.
