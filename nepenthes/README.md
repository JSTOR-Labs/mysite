Images and dried specimens of nepenthes along with textual descriptions of this plant were slow to reach Europe from the mid-1600s through the 1700s. During this period, only three _Nepenthes_ species of the more than [160 accepted today](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:327014-2) were recorded by Europeans, who traveled to the tropics under the aegis of colonial trading companies and rulers.[^ref15] The constellation of European encounters with nepenthes included those of the French colonial governor Étienne de Flacourt with _Nepenthes madagascariensis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="-19.851956606106267, 47.10416219453961">Madagascar,</span> the Dutch-Polish merchant and botanist Jacob Breyne with _Nepenthes distillatoria_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="7.285398878746777, 80.64775966499727">Sri Lanka,</span> and the Portuguese Jesuit missionary and botanist João de Loureiro with _Nepenthes mirabilis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="16.250907711663363, 102.3281993917686">Vietnam.</span>[^ref16] Their contributions to the field of botany and natural history notwithstanding, information about nepenthes remained scarce in part because it was so labor intensive and costly to produce visual and verbal records of foreign flora in the tropics and equally so to publish a finished manuscript in Europe.

The difficulties of producing an herbal are exemplified by the tumultuous history of the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius’s [_Herbarium Amboinense_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10702) from 1741–53.[^ref17] Nearly a century elapsed between the book’s initial creation in Ambon, then part of Dutch-controlled Indonesia, and its publication in Amsterdam. In 1657, Rumphius achieved the rank of second merchant for the Dutch East India Company and several years later began his study of Ambon’s flora and fauna, which includes his scientific description of two ‘_Cantherifera_’ (now known as _Nepenthes mirabilis_).[^ref18] Naming rights to the tropical pitcher plant, of course, went to Carl Linnaeus whose research was published before Rumphius’s _Herbarium Amboinense_.[^ref19] The herbal’s publication was delayed after the nearly completed book was destroyed by fire in 1687 and, later, after the original copy of the rewritten version was lost at sea in 1692. In the intervening years, Rumphius lost his vision from glaucoma and that slowed his ability to reconstruct the text aided by assistants. Once the full six-volume manuscript reached the <span data-click-map-flyto="52.07034238316786, 5.574769961028949">Netherlands</span> in 1701, the Dutch East India Company temporarily halted its publication to protect the firm’s trade secrets pertaining to nutmeg and clove.
