### “...A Small Vase, with Its Own Lid, a Wonderful Sight”

Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the world. Their leaf adaptions, which are nothing less than extraordinary, evolved to facilitate dietary diversity.[^ref1] In the case of _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, just as the plant’s enlarged wing-shaped petioles absorb sunlight to fuel the synthesis of glucose, so too its highly modified pitcher-like leaves attract, capture, kill, and ingest prey. More remarkable still, _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows not one but two types of pitchers—first lower and then upper ones—that specialize in trapping specific foods. While squat low-lying pitchers catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, tapered aerial ones seize flying insects. Nepenthes’ fantastic traps evolved to supplement their diet in habitats with nutrient-poor soil. Yet, as this alluring portrait of _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ suggests, the plant’s curious and beautiful pitchers also shaped its interactions with humans, sparking excitement among European colonial explorers, botanists, horticulturalists, artists, and collectors alike.[^ref2]

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.

### Predator-Prey and Symbiotic Relationships 

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades. Indeed, Adolphe Alphand’s book [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i) inventories the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees used to beautify these green spaces, between 1853 and 1870. Needless to say, garden designers and horticulturalists chose many showy pelargoniums, reserving at least eight glasshouses, at a newly constructed municipal nursery, for cultivating them. Although Alphand primarily celebrated the aesthetic effect produced by bedding brightly hued pelargoniums en masse, the flowers served other functions too. The French- and European-bred flowers, which retained some of their exotic associations with Africa, exemplified the global reach of the Second French Empire because the plant was being used as an economic crop in French Algeria.
