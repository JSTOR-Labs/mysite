### “A Small Vase, with Its Own Lid, a Wonderful Sight”
Images and dried specimens of nepenthes along with textual descriptions of this plant were slow to reach Europe from the mid-1600s through the 1700s. During this period, only three _Nepenthes_ species of the more than 160 accepted today were recorded by Europeans. The slow pace of identifications was partly due to the labor, time, and cost involved in finding and describing foreign flora in the tropics for publication in Europe and partly due to the limited range of some species to an isolated geographic region. While the greatest species diversity is concentrated in the Philippines, Borneo, and Sumatra, the earliest recorded colonial encounters occurred in other places in which there was only one or two endemic species present.

While such studies often relied on the assistance of indigenous peoples to locate and describe plants, European assessments of local knowledge must be interpreted with a healthy dose of skepticism because they tended to omit, misconstrue, or diminished information to accommodate a Eurocentric world view.

While early conquistadors disparaged maize, from the nineteenth century onwards, the crop began to attract the attention of scientists from Europe and the United States due to its productivity and economic potential both as a domestic and export crop. In the early twentieth century, scientists from the US and Europe traveled to regions in Mexico, Peru, and Guatemala, among others to identify unique “landraces,” (Q174030)  or locally adapted domesticates, of maize.  Historian of science Helen Curry has detailed how scientists attempted to transpose putative human race science onto maize taxonomies: “At the most fundamental level, the raw material and motivation for classification arose directly from the imperative of ‘improvement’ in both crops and people.”  These scientists presented a vision of “early, stable indigenous races, transformed by racial mixing with newly arriving populations from other geographical regions, giving rise to valuable new ‘incipient’ but still-unstable racial types.”
