Nepenthes are among the most wondrous carnivorous plants in the world. This group of tropical climbing vines, shrubs, and epiphytes developed extraordinary leaf adaptations that compensate for the nutrient-poor soil typical of their native habitat, which ranges from Madagascar and the Seychelles to parts of Southeast Asia and Oceania.[^ref1] _Nepenthes rafflesiana_, for example, evolved wing-shaped petioles capable of absorbing sunlight to fuel the synthesis of glucose (photosynthesis) and highly modified pitcher-like leaves capable of deriving nutrients from prey and animal feces. More remarkable still, as _Nepenthes rafflesiana_ grows, it develops not one but two types of pitchers (leaf dimorphism) that look and function differently. While <span data-click-image-zoomto="1">squat low-lying pitchers</span> catch creepy crawlies and small vertebrates, <span data-click-image-zoomto="2">their tapered aerial counterparts</span> trap flying insects and collect bat guano. Yet, prior to the publication of scientific research on plant carnivory in the mid-1870s, the significance of nepenthes’ pitchers in the wild was a botanical mystery that enthralled European colonial settlers, naturalists, traders, collectors, botanists, and artists for more than 200 years.[^ref2]

Just as mysterious as the form and function of nepenthes’ pitchers was their potential use to humans in domestication. The cultural importance of these mysteries for Europeans and their efforts to resolve them were visually articulated by artists since the 1650s. The earliest known European image and description of nepenthes were published in the French colonial governor of Madagascar Étienne de Flacourt’s book [_Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar_](https://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.do?id=406802) of 1658.[^ref3] <span data-click-image-zoomto="4">Its tiny picture of nepenthes</span> shows a pitcher with a once-coiled tendril attached to a petiole, emphasizing botanical parts that excited wonder and were presumed to be useful to humans. In his <span data-click-image-zoomto="5">accompanying text,</span> Flacourt describes the ‘_Anramitaco_’ (now named _Nepenthes madagascariensis_) pitcher as, “a hollow flower or fruit resembling a small vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight.”[^ref4] Mistaking this foliar structure for a reproductive organ or fruit, Flacourt could never have imagined that it was actually a highly modified leaf, nor dreamed of its specialized function to attract, trap, kill, and digest prey. The mysteries of nepenthes’ pitchers persisted through the 1700s, though things dramatically changed with an unprecedented increase in plant mobility in the early 1800s.

A cultural history of nepenthes focused on nineteenth-century London, Ghent, and Paris reveals how artists contributed to a sudden explosion of interest in pitcher plants and their display in modern urban spaces. By the early 1800s, expanding colonial trade networks and faster modes of land and maritime travel coupled with the invention of the Wardian case—a [glazed case](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/botany-of-empire/plant-transportation/on-the-growth-of-plants-in-closely-glazed-cases) for shipping live plants—and glasshouse technologies brought nepenthes into sustained cultivation in Europe for the first time.[^ref5] At the same time, commercial nurseries and botanical publishers commissioned artists to portray nepenthes in horticultural advertisements and ornamental portraits, sparking a new visual language for representing this plant. Likewise, artists of the mid-1870s developed another set of conventions for depicting nepenthes’ predation on insects in journals and newspapers reporting on recent discoveries of plant carnivory. By considering how these images participated in a broader transformative moment in human-plant relations in the late nineteenth-century, this visual narrative also proposes a link between the modern era’s shifting cultural attitudes toward plants and a contemporary societal problem known as “plant blindness.”[^ref6]

### Nepenthes: Generic Name and Mythical Drug

Much like a botanical illustration, the generic name Nepenthes was selected to call to mind a type specimen and its defining characteristics. The illustrious Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus chose the name _Nepenthes_,[^ref7] from the Greek [νηπενθές](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=nhpenqh/s) (without grief), to conjure an image of a tropical pitcher plant by alluding to a mythical drug described in Homer’s _Odyssey_.[^ref8] In a scene from Book IV, Helen of Troy offers a vessel of wine mixed with _nepenthe_ to her husband Menelaus, who has returned from the Trojan War, to induce a pleasant state of forgetfulness.[^ref9] On this episode’s relationship to the plant, Linnaeus wrote, “If this is not Helen’s _Nepenthes_, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator.”[^ref10] Linnaeus here compares his first botanical encounter with a tropical pitcher plant to the experience of Menelaus in thrall to the powerful drug _nepenthe_, leaving no doubt about the plant’s power to captivate humans.

Linnaeus wrote this description of nepenthes for his 1738 book [_Hortus Cliffortianus_](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11198) while living in the Netherlands.[^ref11] This botanical catalogue was commissioned from him by the wealthy Anglo-Dutch banker George Clifford III, who was a Director of the Dutch East India Company, to document his magnificent live and dried plant collections at Hartekamp, outside Haarlem.[^ref12] Although _Hortus Cliffortianus_ does not contain any portraits of nepenthes, the type specimen upon which Linnaeus based his description may still survive in the [Clifford Herbarium.](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/botanical-collections/clifford-herbarium/) The dried plant is mounted on a sheet bearing a <span data-click-image-zoomto="28,1781,568,528">printed cartouche label</span> with the name _Nepenthes distillatoria_ and a <span data-click-image-zoomto="377,1708,568,528">printed decorative urn</span> that now serves as an identifying mark of Clifford’s ownership.[^ref13] <span data-click-image-zoomto="-103,101,1528,1421">The specimen’s pressed petiole,</span> wire thin tendril, and partly preserved pitchers gave eighteenth-century botanists intimate access to and evidentiary proof of nepenthes that was not otherwise attainable without traveling to the tropics. Yet, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this medium: it flattens plants and displays their parts artificially positioned for the sake of clarity while, at the same time, extracting them from their biological contexts.[^ref14] For these reasons, botanists of Linnaeus’s day studied herbarium specimens alongside illustrations and text to gain a fuller picture of plants, especially when live specimens were not readily available.

Images and dried specimens of nepenthes along with textual descriptions of this plant were slow to reach Europe from the mid-1600s through the 1700s.

The difficulties of producing an herbal are exemplified by the tumultuous history of the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius’s [_Herbarium Amboinense_,](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/10702) from 1741–53.[^ref17] Nearly a century elapsed between the book’s initial creation in Ambon, then part of Dutch-controlled Indonesia, and its publication in Amsterdam. In 1657, Rumphius achieved the rank of second merchant for the Dutch East India Company and several years later began his study of Ambon’s flora and fauna, which includes his scientific description of two ‘_Cantherifera_’ (now known as _Nepenthes mirabilis_).[^ref18] Naming rights to the tropical pitcher plant, of course, went to Carl Linnaeus whose research was published before Rumphius’s _Herbarium Amboinense_.[^ref19] The herbal’s publication was delayed after the nearly completed book was destroyed by fire in 1687 and, later, after the original copy of the rewritten version was lost at sea in 1692. In the intervening years, Rumphius lost his vision from glaucoma and that slowed his ability to reconstruct the text aided by assistants. Once the full six-volume manuscript reached the <span data-click-map-flyto="52.07034238316786, 5.574769961028949">Netherlands</span> in 1701, the Dutch East India Company temporarily halted its publication to protect the firm’s trade secrets pertaining to nutmeg and clove.

Rumphius’s _Herbarium Amboinense_ contains nearly 700 illustrations that were hand-drawn, engraved, and printed by many artists.[^ref20] Significantly, Book VII includes an unsigned portrait of nepenthes (Fig. 2) shown with another plant (Fig. 1) now named _Flagellaria_. This print exemplifies some visual conventions for representing plants that were also followed by the makers of herbarium sheets. The image’s three nepenthes have petioles, tendrils, and pitchers that are mostly positioned flat—in left or right profile. As with herbarium specimens, this strategy was used to ensure the clarity of plant morphology. Each plant possesses a racemose-like inflorescence that is rendered with enough precision to suggest that the ones pictured in the left and center are male and the one in the upper right corner is female. If that were so, it would be a mistake because nepenthes are dioecious: male plants grow only staminate flowers and females grow only pistillate ones that develop seed pods after pollination. Similarly problematic, the mature plant with a taproot is shown with an offshoot from which grows a clone that should be the same sex as its parent. Nonetheless, the illustration adhered to a visual language then used to communicate valuable information about a plant’s leaves, root system, and reproductive organs—a language from which nineteenth-century artists departed when producing horticultural advertisements focused mainly on plant aesthetics.

In 1825, the Loddiges family nursery of Hackney, London published the first illustration of a nepenthes cultivated in Europe, in its full-color catalogue [_The Botanical Cabinet_.](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/29220781#page/36/mode/1up)[^ref21] This hand-colored plate showing _Nepenthes khasia_, which was then incorrectly identified as _Nepenthes distillatoria_, was engraved by George Cooke after a design by his pupil Thomas Shotter Boys. The image was truly revolutionary for its day—both the plant and the manner of representing it were new and exciting. Indeed, Boys’ design dispensed with many conventions of eighteenth-century botanical illustrations and herbarium sheets, such as showing a full view of an optically flattened specimen, to instead embrace a more dynamic and collage-like composition.[^ref22] By overlapping close-up views of a scarlet-tangerine-and-lime lidded pitcher and an inflorescence with muted white-and-pink pistillate flowers, the artist recast these disembodied plant parts as aestheticized objects of wonder. What was being advertised here was not just a nepenthes plant grown from seeds harvested in British Ceylon or India, but also the opportunity for Londoners to visit this botanical curiosity at their leisure at the Loddiges nursery. There, in a massive, heated conservatory, one could enjoy the colonial privilege of an intimate encounter with this plant.[^ref23]

Mysteriously enough, little mention of nepenthes was made in the realm of horticulture for the next twenty years. Perhaps it proved too difficult for the Loddiges nursery to keep its tropical pitcher plant alive in cultivation. Things dramatically changed in the 1840s, however, with the shipping of the first live pitcher plant to Europe and with the widespread adoption of the Wardian case for doing so.[^ref24] Because nepenthes’ native range overlapped geographically with European colonial expansion, transregional horticultural networks were able to leverage asymmetrical power relations to exploitatively harvest this plant and profit from selling propagated clones or seedlings to the wealthy elite of Europe. By the 1850s and 1860s, a huge influx of nepenthes reached European nurseries and the plant’s likeness slowly began to appear in horticultural journals. Although these lavishly illustrated publications promoted ostentatious flowers and exotic foliage shrubs, nepenthes’ viscerally evocative and enigmatic pitchers were matchless and surely appealed to a subset of connoisseurs with a taste for botanical eccentricity.

### The French Connection: From Municipal Parks to Glasshouses and Storefronts

The pelargonium was also a tremendously fashionable flower in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in Paris. As part of a massive urban renewal project, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, prefect of Seine, oversaw the creation or revitalization of Parisian public parks, gardens, squares, and promenades.

This luminous portrait of _Nepenthes hookerii_ is one of (if not the) most dazzling pictures of a nepenthes produced during the late 1800s. The color print shows a somewhat ponderously balanced nepenthes with a small root system, basal rosette of young leaves, and elegant climbing vine from which radiate petioles with sinuous tendrils and squat pitchers. Close-up views of pitchers, shown on the left edge and in the top right corner, emphasize their aesthetic allure: rows of fringe-like what and mottled pattern of purple what. The illustration was designed by the Frenchman Pierre Lambotte—then the resident artist of Paris’s nursery complex Fleuriste de la Muette. Lambotte’s design was translated into the medium of chromolithography by the Ghent-based printmaker NAME Severeyns whose worked for the noted horticultural journal NAME NAME. The finely executed portrait celebrates _Nepenthes hookerii_’s use as an exotic ornamental in Parisian municipal gardens, which were newly created and replanted during a massive urban renewal project. It was published as part of a set in Adolphe Alphand’s [_Les Promenades de Paris_](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:47665956$1i), from 1868–73, documenting the myriad plants, shrubs, and trees planted in the French capital along with the many technological advances that made it possible to do so.
