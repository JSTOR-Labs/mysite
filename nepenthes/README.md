       description=“The domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus, is an iconic plant. The sunflower’s widely recognizable characteristics–a yellow flower head, large disk, heart-shaped or ovate leaves, and unbranched stem–have contributed to its popularity as an ornamental garden plant and an aesthetic muse. Because Helianthus annuus has such an imposing presence in many cultural imaginaries, we may be more familiar with sunflower imagery than with the actual flower. In response, this cultural history of the sunflower–attending to the circulation and significance of images–provides rich historical information about the plant and the role of visual culture in communicating the knowledge, myth, and meaning related to it.”>

### “A Small Vase, with Its Own Lid, a Wonderful Sight”
Images and dried specimens of nepenthes along with textual descriptions of this plant were slow to reach Europe from the mid-1600s through the 1700s. During this period, only three _Nepenthes_ species of the more than [160 accepted today](http:// www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:327014-2) were recorded by Europeans. The slow pace of identifications was partly due to the labor, time, and cost involved in finding and describing foreign flora in the tropics for publication in Europe and partly due to the limited range of some species to an isolated geographic region. While the greatest species diversity is concentrated in the Philippines, Borneo, and Sumatra, the earliest recorded colonial encounters occurred in other places in which there was only one or two endemic species present.

A constellation of European encounters with nepenthes the second half of the 1600s included those of the French colonial governor of Madagascar Étienne de Flacourt with _Nepenthes madagascariensis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="-19.851956606106267, 47.10416219453961, 6">Madagascar,</span> the Dutch-Polish merchant and botanist Jacob Breyne with _Nepenthes distillatoria_ in <span data-click-map- flyto="7.285398878746777, 80.64775966499727, 6">Sri Lanka,</span> and the Portuguese Jesuit missionary and botanist João de Loureiro with _Nepenthes mirabilis_ in <span data-click-map-flyto="16.250907711663363, 102.3281993917686, 5.5">Vietnam.</span> They traveled to the southern tropics under the aegis of colonial trading companies and rulers, recording findings about native flora for botanical publications. While such studies often relied on the assistance of indigenous peoples to locate and describe plants, European assessments of local knowledge must be interpreted with a healthy dose of skepticism because they tended to omit, misconstrue, or diminished information to accommodate a Eurocentric world view.
