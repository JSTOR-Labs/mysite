## What's in a name?
There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet geranium.[^datg] With their vibrant red flowers and sweet, rosy scent, these cheerful plants always adorned the dining table and dominated the garden in a “blaze of color”[^mfsirh] at his country home, Gad’s Hill Place. Attendees at his public readings could always count on seeing a scarlet geranium displayed in his buttonhole, and his appreciation of them was such that his daughter, Mamie Dickens, even recalls her sister having said to him, “I believe, papa, that when you become an angel your wings will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet geraniums”[^mfsirh].

However, you might be surprised to learn that the red flower with which Dickens was so enamoured was not actually a Geranium. **In fact, it was a Pelargonium - *Pelargonium inquinans*, to be exact.** These two genera, similar but not exactly the same in terms of their morphology, have been embroiled in a long history of taxonomic confusion. In his famous *Species Plantarum* published in 1735, Carl Linnaeus mistakenly grouped Pelargoniums and Geraniums together into one genus, and that misgrouping ended up persisting for centuries - even after subsequent naturalists had proven that they were, in reality, two different genera. The public simply grew accustomed to using the name Geranium for both types of plant, and for the most part, we continue to use it in this way today.

So how can we tell the history of the forgotten Pelargonium, a plant that is a familiar cultural fixture for so many of us - but one that so few people know by its true identity? Perhaps it is time to put the *Geranium* (scarlet or otherwise) to one side, and to narrate instead the lesser-known story of the *Pelargonium*, from its impact in the industrial, cultural, and social sphere, to the particular morphological make-up that caused all this nomenclature trouble in the first place.

## Global industrial production of geranium oils
The essential oil extraction industry provides the base material for pharmaceutical and cosmetic production, among which is the perfume industry. The extraction of these oils is done by distillation and not taken directly, and the substances that evaporate and condense again come from the leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits and seeds. This natural extraction involves the creation of extensive crops, factories, and the hiring of high labor. In this way, the industry not only generates an international commercial network but also reorganizes and transforms the territory.


The most common known geranium oil is actually from one species of *Pelargoniums*, *P. graveolens* (also known as Geranium Rosat). However, when the essential oil was distilled and introduced to the French colonies in Africa, it was actually a few years earlier than the first distinction of pelargoniums as an independent genus by L’Héritier in 1787. Therefore, the essential oil was inevitably misnamed as geranium oil, and this misnomer is still used nowadays.
<param ve-plant-specimen jpid="10.5555/al.ap.specimen.k000417315">

The Chiris factory in Algeria provides a case study for the industrial production of Pelargonium essential oils (commonly known as Geranium oils). Founded in 1786 in the city of Grasse, near Monaco and the port of Marseille, the Chiris company specialized in the extraction of essential oils for the cosmetic industry. After the French Revolution in 1789, the perfume business began a process of democratization in which consumers no longer belonged only to the aristocracy but also to the bourgeoisie. This process was accentuated once the Industrial Revolution began to change the forms and systems of production and distribution and it was also accompanied by the colonial commercial networks. In 1865, the company built a 3,000 square metre factory in the Saint-Marguerite domain in Boufarik, Algeria, which had previously been acquired in 1836. Its production was centred on pelargoniums, orange trees and other aromatic plants: "Léon Chiris organizes the exploitation of the lands acquired in Algeria since 1836 by his father Léopold Chiris : the Sainte-Marguerite estate in Boufarik. In 1865, 800 hectares were covered with geraniums, oranges, cassis and eucalyptus trees, which were then used in the construction of a 3,000 meter plant in the Arab style."[^dsmdlcab] However, the headquarters in Boufarik closed once it was nationalized in 1963, as did the other headquarters in the former European colonies. 
<param ve-storiiies id="091ed">

It is key here to note that Pelargoniums, in this case called Geraniums, cannot stand the low temperatures of winter, so planting them in the warm lands of African colonies was considered the best place for production. Likewise, the low cost of colonial labour to carry out the processes of "preparation and planting of cuttings, weeding of fields, harvesting of the material to be distilled" favoured agro-economic operations in these territories. These are the two main reasons why the plant was introduced in Algeria in 1847 by the perfume industries of Grasse, including the company of Léon Chiris. As previously mentioned, the interest in Pelargoniums comes from its sweet aroma, which is considered similar to that of roses in most of its species. The Pelargonium introduced in Algeria was the "geranium rosat", the result of hybridisation between other Pelargonium species, and it was the selection "of a trentaine of wild Pelargonium species, from cells that are found most frequently in the Cap de Bonne Espérance region". This selection allowed the Chiris establishments in Boufarik to produce a stable profit number, "If we assume a yield of 25 kilos of petrol per hectare per year and a selling price of 220 francs per kilo of petrol, we obtain a gross income of 5,500 francs per hectare cultivated with Geranium Rosat. [...] In spite of the forecasts of overproduction, it seems although the selling prices for Geranium oil are still interesting. ”[^lpapdcf]

Geranium oil continues to be industrially produced in factories across the globe, most notably in China and Egypt. Since the oil is so easy to store, it is always appreciated as something of a “savings account” by many small farmers as a cash crop. According to IFEAT (the International Federation of Essential Oils and Aroma Trades) 2017’s report: in China, 5,000 to 7,000 families are involved in the production of geranium oil and around 25,000-30,000 people are involved in the whole supply chain; for Egypt, the numbers are 8,000 families and about 30,000-35,000 people.[^pahsoag]

## Pelargonium-mania in the Victorian era
Pelargoniums first arrived in Europe as early as the 16th century, brought in by colonial voyages to South Africa by the Portuguese and the Dutch. However, it was in the Victorian era, when the Industrial Revolution was beginning to take hold, that the cultivation and display of these vivid flowering plants became a veritable cultural event. By this time, the scientific distinctions between Pelargoniums and Geraniums were well known, but Pelargoniums continued to be known for the most part by the misnomer of “Geranium”; in Gertrude Jekyll’s 1919 publication *Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden*, she remarks to this effect that, “There are no better summer flowers than the single and double zonal Pelargoniums that we commonly call Geraniums”.[^csftfg]
<param ve-image
title="Image of geranium “stock house” in 1910 geranium catalogue" url="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageimage/47651101" fit="cover" rotate="270" attribution="Biodiversity Heritage Library">

These Pelargoniums were hardy evergreen plants, so they would show off their blooms all season round, even in slightly chillier climates.  They were also easy to propagate and affordable to buy. However, perhaps most importantly of all, they could be hybridized into a seemingly infinite number of beautifully colourful cultivars. The Victorians were just enchanted by the range of varieties that were available, and before too long, vendors were falling over one another to market the newest, most magnificent, and sweetest-smelling specimens. Compounded by the arrival of mass production of pots and planters, as well as the Pelargonium’s year-round accessibility, the demand for potted Pelargoniums grew exponentially. The situation became so frenzied that some even began to compare it to the infamous “tulipomania” that transpired in 17th-century Holland.[^lotp]

By the end of the Industrial Revolution, the *Pelargonium* was firmly instated as a staple in British domestic interiors, gardens, and patios; writing in 1895, Donald McDonald remarks that, “no bouquet or basket of flowers was considered complete unless plentifully perfumed with the foliage of Cape or other sweet Pelargoniums”.[^sslafl] In his 1875 book *The amateur's flower garden*, Shirley Hibberd designed several layouts for the creation of a harmonious “geranium garden” (of course, really a Pelargonium garden) based on the plant’s striking colour variations. In the layout of a panel garden, Hibbers suggests two potential summer schemes: one for a red-harmony garden, and one in a blue-harmony style.[^tafg]

### The "genteel" geranium and working-class culture
The *Pelargonium’s* ubiquity in the Victorian era eventually began to carry a cultural significance all its own. In 1864’s *The Book of Flowers*, Caroline Kirkland follows the poet Leigh Hunt in describing the “Geranium” (of course, really a Pelargonium) as a *genteel* plant. She writes, “As the Geranium offers so large a variety of species to gratify every taste, it is appropriately called genteel”.[^tbof] Of course, this might be understood as an attestation to the *Pelargonium’s* universal charms. However, if we look a little closer at the ways the Pelargonium was used in working class culture, we might suggest that the “genteel” nature of the plant actually be taken with a pinch of salt. 
<param ve-image static
title="The broad range of varieties and scents of Pelargonium (under the name Geranium, of course) made it a favourite in the Victorian “language of flowers.” This concealed language allowed members of upper-class society to use specific flowers as a sort of code to pass on secret, often romantic, messages that they were forbidden from speaking aloud. Here, we can see that the scarlet Geranium (*P. inquinans*) means “comfort.”" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/master/images/Victorian_language_of_flowers_.jpg" fit="contain" attribution="Source from Biodiversity Heritage Library, edited by Yao Jiang.">

For many lower-class Victorian families who did not have gardens, growing Pelargoniums in pots and displaying them in windows or balconies became a way to try and project a sense of belonging with the higher classes of the population. In other words, they became a visual marker for the lower classes’ (often awkward) attempts to convey a social standing superior to their own. Naturally, such attempts rarely landed in the way they were intended, and before long, horticulturalists began to look down on the Pelargonium with a certain derision as a result. Jekyll writes in 1919 that, “It is a common thing for friends to express surprise at seeing scarlet Geraniums...in my garden, forgetting that it was not the fault of the plants that they were misused or employed in dull or even stupid ways”.[^csftfg] This makes it clear that it was not the plants themselves that were particularly offensive to garden specialists; rather, it was the way they had been used by certain cack-handed individuals, presumably the lower classes, that made them such a subject of scorn in horticultural circles.

Partridge & Co, c. 1869. Children’s Book Collection. Library Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, UCLA https://archive.org/details/jennysgeraniumor00bostiala">

As a result, the *Pelargonium* soon became a symbol for the working class’s ungainly attempts at propriety, and was instrumentalized as such throughout art and literature. Catherine Horwood notes that, “If there is one plant that sums up the attitude of Victorian sentimentalists towards the unfortunate working class in the nineteenth century, it is the forlorn red ‘geranium’ sitting on a cottage window-sill. Hundreds of artists used this as a symbol of aspirations to respectability”.[^ph] With this context, we might understand Kirkland’s pretensions to the “genteel geranium” as an ironic statement, more in line with the OED’s definition of “genteel” as “being characteristic of those who are possessed with a dread of being taken for ‘common people’, or who attach exaggerated importance to supposed marks of social superiority...in educated language it has always a sarcastic or at least playful colouring,”[^genteel] than to assertions of true gentility.

## Geraniums or Pelargoniums?
Despite its long history of being known by a “false identity,” then, we can see that the *Pelargonium* has actually had a significant impact through its various sensorial, economic, and material-cultural entanglements with the human realm. But why exactly has the misnomer of Geranium persisted for so long? To answer this question, we can take a brief look at the two plants’ morphologies and their overlapping nomenclature history.
<param ve-storiiies id="a51fu"> 

### Morphological differentiations
The Pelargonium is a perennial bush, with a strong and aromatic smell. There are approximately 300 species of Pelargonium, originating from Southern Africa, St. Helena, Asia Minor, Madagascar, and Australia (the Geranium only has roots in the Cape region of South Africa). The particular morphology of the plant actually lends the genus its name; *Pelargonium* comes from the Greek word *pelargos* (“stork”) which alludes to the long, almost beak-shaped fruit. 

In order to differentiate between the genera of Pelargonium and Geranium, it is necessary to focus on the reproductive system of the plant: the flower. In the Pelargonium, the arrangement of the flower parts is bilateral and not radial (as it is the case in the Geranium), which is to say that it has only one axis of symmetry. While the Geranium has five nectaries at the base of the petals, the Pelargonium has only one embedded in the receptacle. A final difference is the number of fertile stamens and their groupings. The Pelargonium has between one and seven stamens, attached at the base; the Geranium,  meanwhile, has either five or ten free stamens.

### A brief history of nomenclature confusion
Historically, the misnomer started more than 150 years before Linnaean taxonomy, when *P. triste* was brought and cultivated at the Leiden Botanical Garden(the herbaria on the right is identified as *Pelargonium triste (L.)* according to the manuscript on the bottom right). While Carl Linnaeus, in his 1753 *Species Plantarum*, retained the generic name *Geranium* for 20 pelargoniums known at that time (such as the *Pelargonium zonale*), continuing the ignorance of pelargoniums as a new genus.[^sp] Since Linnaean taxonomy was treated almost like a bible in the academic field at that time, even though Charles-Louis L’Héritier subsequently distinguished *Pelargoniums* as an independent genus, the Linnaean *Geranium* nomenclature for pelargoniums continued - as can be seen in Aloysio Cabrini’s *Boccone Museum rariorum plantarum: nominibus linnaei specificis* (1791), currently housed in Dumbarton Oaks’ Rare Book Collection.[^bmrp] Eventually, by creating ten new genera in the *Geraniaceae* family, Robert Sweet introduced a serious classification system to ease the shortfall in Linnaean nomenclature in 1820.[^g] However, this new taxonomy system seems only to be accepted and followed in the academic field rather than the public domain.

Besides the Algerian oil industry and the Victorian floriculture mentioned here, there must be more areas in which pelargoniums are misnamed and understood as geraniums in terms of the history of nomenclature confusion. For example, this nomenclature confusion has even permeated into Chinese literature translations and China's oil industry. For Chinese, *Tianzhu Kui* (*Pelargonium*) is the most commonly used name once mentioning these two genera. However, once *Tianzhu Kui* is translated into English, *Geranium* turns out to be the associated word. Taking Harper Lee’s famous novel *To Kill a Mockingbird* as an example, the word “geraniums” from “against the fence … holding brilliant red geraniums” is always translated as *Tianzhu Kui* rather than its actually botanical name, *Laoguan Cao*. Also, as one of the two major producers in the essential oil industry nowadays,  more than 50% of Chinese packaging uses “Geranium Essential Oil” as its English translation, even though the product is labeled as *Tianzhu Kui You (Pelargonium Oil)* in Chinese. It is said that the name *Tianzhu Kui* was introduced by Junyu Zhang in 1933 based on his studies in Japan. The word *Tianzhu Kui* is from *ゼラニウム*, which is pronounced as *Geranium* in English. **From this point of view, we can deduce that the misnomer did not only happen in the Western world; it has circulated and influenced other knowledge traditions worldwide. Therefore, it is the time to clarify this misnomer, and to “redeem” the story of Pelargoniums both West and East.**
