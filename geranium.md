As a **cultural commodity**, few flowers have as broad a reach as the hardy geranium. From its arresting ornamental displays in gardens, balconies, and domestic interiors across the globe, to its extraction for use in essential oils, perfumes, food flavourings, and medicines, the geranium’s bright blooms and sweet scent are a familiar cultural fixture for many of us. However, most people are not aware that when we talk about geraniums, more often than not, we are using a misnomer. In fact, we should be using the name pelargonium. Since both the geranium and the pelargonium are flowering plants native to South Africa, and share many qualities of herbaceous perennials, pelargoniums have been erroneously grouped with geraniums as one genus for centuries.

## Geraniums or pelargoniums?
### Morphological differentiations
The pelargonium is a perennial bush, with a strong and aromatic smell. There are approximately 300 species, originating from Southern Africa, St. Helena, Asia Minor, Madagascar, and Australia. The particular morphology of the plant actually lends the genus its name; pelargonium comes from the Greek word pelargos (“stork”) which alludes to the long, almost beak-shaped fruit. Similarly, the word geranium comes from the Greek word geranos (“crane”). This imagery pertaining to a long, slender beak persists even across languages; in English the geranium is often known as “cranes-bill,” in Dutch Ooievaaarsbeck (also “cranes-bill”), and in Chinese Laoguan Cao Shu (“old-crane grass”). 

In order to differentiate between the genera of Pelargonium and Geranium, it is necessary to focus on the reproductive system of the plant: the flower. In the Pelargonium, the arrangement of the flower parts is bilateral and not radial (as it is the case in the Geranium), which is to say that it has only one axis of symmetry. While the Geranium has five nectaries at the base of the petals, the Pelargonium has only one embedded in the receptacle. A final difference between the genera is the number of fertile stamens and their grouping. The Pelargonium has between one and seven stamens, attached at the base; Geranium has either five or ten free stamens. 

### A brief history of nomenclature confusion
Before 1787, _Geranium_ was used as the generic name for both pelargoniums and geraniums. Even though Dillenius suggested that the species with unequal and irregular flowers might be called Pelargonia vocare as early as 1732,[^he] his suggestion was not widely accepted. In his 1753 Species Plantarum, Linnaeus retained the generic name Geranium for 20 pelargoniums known at that time, continuing the ignorance of pelargoniums as a new genus.

It was not until Charles-Louis L’Héritier’s Geraniologia (1787-88) that pelargoniums were clearly distinguished as an independent genus. This was also the first time that an illustration of the Pelargonium graveolens was introduced to the public. However, contemporary scholars still paid little attention to this clarification, and kept using Linnaean Geranium nomenclature for pelargoniums – as can be seen in Aloysio Cabrini’s Boccone Museum rariorum plantarum: nominibus linnaei specificis (1791), currently housed in Dumbarton Oaks’ Rare Book Collection.

The confusion between Pelargoniums and Geraniums lasted for another four decades, until Robert Sweet published his Geraniacae in 1820. By creating ten new genera, Sweet introduced a serious classification system for pelargoniums and geraniums, as well as many of the more distinct species. After Augustin Pyramus de Candolle’s simplification in 1824, this taxonomy system was gradually accepted and followed in the academic field. Later, in the 1960s, South African taxonomists began a major study of the genus Pelargonium with the development of the local Botanical Research Institute. According to the publication of The Herb Society of America in 2006, genetic testing has now been introduced for Pelargonium classifications.

### Nomenclature familiarities between West and East
Due to the long history of confusion over nomenclature, it seems that most of the public still uses the name Geranium instead of Pelargonium in English-speaking countries. However, the Chinese seem to be more familiar with the translation of Pelargonium as Tianzhu Kui Shu (Tianzhu is the historical name for India, Kui means sunflower, Shu means genus) rather than Geranium as Laoguan Cao Shu (literally meaning old-crane grass). Instead of the historical confusion that occurred in European history, it is the nomenclature aesthetics and imaginations for exoticism rooted in Chinese knowledge traditions that make the Chinese more culturally familiar with Tianzhu Kui. Taking Harper Lee’s famous novel To Kill a Mockingbird as an example, the word “geraniums” from “[a]gainst the fence … holding brilliant red geraniums” is translated as Tianzhu Kui instead of Laoguan Cao as its associated botanical name.

## Usages of geraniums
### Global industrial production of geranium oils
The Pelargonium’s capacity for producing sweet-scented aromatic substances has rendered it an important commodity in the pharmaceutical and aesthetic industry. The glandular trichomes on the surface of the leaves allow the plant to naturally produce essential oil (known as “geranium oil”), which can be distilled and sold for perfumes and aromatherapy. Likewise, floral water can be extracted from the external organs of the plant, not only the leaves, but also the flowers and stems.   

The Chiris factory in Algeria provides a case study for the industrial production of Pelargonium essential oils (commonly known as Geranium oils). A French company founded in 1786 in the city of Grasse, near Monaco and the port of Marseille, Chiris specializes in the extraction of essential oils for the cosmetic industry. After the French Revolution in 1789, the perfume business began a process of democratization in which consumers no longer belonged only to the aristocracy but also to the bourgeoisie. This process was accentuated once the Industrial Revolution began to change the forms and systems of production and distribution and was accompanied by the colonial commercial networks. In 1865, the company built a 3,000 square metre factory in the Saint-Marguerite domain in Boufarik, Algeria, which had previously been acquired in 1836. Its production was centred on geraniums, orange trees and other aromatic plants: 

_"Léon Chiris organizes the exploitation of the lands acquired in Algeria since 1836 by his father Léopold Chiris : the Sainte-Marguerite estate in Boufarik. In 1865, 800 hectares were covered with geraniums, oranges, cassis and eucalyptus trees, which were then used in the construction of a 3,000 meter plant in the Arab style."_

However, the headquarters in Boufarik closed once it was nationalized in 1963, as did the other headquarters in the former European colonies. 

It is key here to note that Pelargoniums, in this case called Geraniums, cannot stand the low temperatures of winter, so planting them in the warm lands of African colonies was considered the best place for production. Likewise, the low cost of colonial labour to carry out the processes of "préparation et la plantation des boutures, le désherbage des champs, la récolte de la matière à distiller" favoured agro-economic operations in these territories. These are the two main reasons why the plant was introduced in Algeria in 1847 by the perfume industries of Grasse, including the company of Léon Chiris. As previously mentioned, the interest in Pelargoniums comes from its sweet aroma, which is considered similar to that of roses in most of its species. The Pelargonium introduced in Algeria was the "geranium rosat", the result of hybridisation with other Pelargonium species, and it was the selection "of a trentaine of wild Pelargonium species, from cells that are found most frequently in the Cap de Bonne Espérance region".

Geranium oil continues to be industrially produced in factories across the globe, most notably in China and Egypt. Since the oil is so easy to store, it is always appreciated as something of a “savings account” by many small farmers as a cash crop. According to IFEAT (the International Federation of Essential Oils and Aroma Trades) 2017’s report: in China, 5,000 to 7,000 families are involved in the production of geranium oil and around 25,000-30,000 people are involved in the whole supply chain; for Egypt, the numbers are 8,000 families and about 30,000-35,000 people.

### Traditional uses
The industrial use of Pelargonium is not the only one. Traditional local South African use of the plants focuses on their medicinal properties. Among the healing actions of different species of Pelargoniums are: relief of gastric cramps and disorders, urinary and menstrual problems, diarrhea, venereal diseases and bladder infections (oral use); relief of bronchial congestion and coughing (inhaled use); control of hemorrhoids, open wounds and eczema (topical use). This has generated interest in the pharmaceutical uses of Pelargonium and its antibacterial and antioxidant properties.

## Geranium-mania in the Victorian era
Geraniums first arrived in Europe as early as the 16th century, brought in by colonial voyages to South Africa by the Portuguese and the Dutch. However, it was in the Victorian era, when the Industrial Revolution was beginning to take hold, that geraniums became a veritable craze. They were hardy evergreen plants, so they would show off their blooms all season round, even in slightly chillier climates.  They were also incredibly easy to propagate and affordable to buy. However, perhaps most importantly of all, geraniums could be hybridized into a seemingly infinite number of beautifully colourful cultivars. The Victorians were just enchanted by the gorgeous range of varieties that were available, and before too long, vendors were falling over one another to market the newest, most magnificent, and sweetest-smelling specimens. Compounded by the arrival of mass production of pots and planters, as well as the geranium’s year-round accessibility, the demand for potted geraniums grew exponentially. An 1873 illustration shows the potted geranium as a protagonist of the flower market in the bustling Victorian Covent Garden. The situation soon became so frenzied that some even began to compare it to the infamous “tulipomania” that transpired in 17th-century Holland.

By the end of the Industrial Revolution, the geranium was firmly instated as a staple in all British domestic interiors, gardens, and patios; writing in 1895, Donald McDonald remarks that, “no bouquet or basket of flowers was considered complete unless plentifully perfumed with the foliage of Cape or other sweet Pelargoniums” (93). Geraniums (bedding pelargoniums) also came to be regarded as the bedding plant par excellence for Victorian gardens towards the end of the nineteenth century. In his 1875 book The amateur's flower garden, Shirley Hibberd designed several layouts for the creation of a harmonious geranium garden based on the plant’s striking colour variations. For instance, in the layout of a panel garden, two summer schemes were suggested: one for a red-harmony garden, and one in a blue-harmony style.

The geranium’s very ubiquity eventually began to carry a cultural significance all its own. In 1864’s “The Book of Flowers,” Caroline Kirkland follows the poet Leigh Hunt in describing the geranium as a genteel plant. She writes, “The characteristic of true gentility is the tact to discern the feelings of those around us, and the talent to please each one by appropriate attentions. As the Geranium offers so large a variety of species to gratify every taste, it is appropriately called genteel” (73). In other words, Kirkland suggests that there are so many varieties of geranium out there, there is bound to be one for everyone. It is a universal crowd-pleaser: widespread and affordable enough to be readily available, but still varied enough to always be special. This resonated in particular with the working class. Many such families did not have gardens, but by growing geraniums in windows or balconies, they could still project a sense of belonging with the rest of the population, a homely “sense of decency and worth” (Hartley 7). The flowers became a visual marker of their participation and moral standing in society. Soon, the geranium became a symbol for working-class life throughout art and literature; Charles Dickens, especially, often turned to geraniums as a character motif in many of his most famous works. 

Despite resisting concrete taxonomizing for such a long time (and continuing to be known by a misnomer even today), the geranium came to carry an excess of meanings as it criss-crossed the globe in networks of trade, communication between naturalists and colonial botanists, and representations in art and literature. Through its various sensorial and material entanglements with human culture, it came to signify rapid transnational economic development, genteel style, botanical hybridising prowess, and Victorian working-class domesticity. To add one more string to its meaning-making bow, it even featured heavily in the so-called Victorian language of flowers. This concealed language allowed members of upper-class society to use specific flowers as a sort of code to pass on secret, often romantic, messages that they were forbidden from speaking aloud. Each scent of geranium was purported to carry a different meaning, and giving a certain cultivar to a loved one (or indeed an enemy) would clandestinely pass on that specific sentiment to the recipient. 

However, what goes up must of course come down – and, by the end of the 19th century, enthusiasm for the geranium had significantly waned. They had become a little too popular, and people began to grow tired of them; the bright colours of their blooms, once considered striking and exotic, came to be seen as cheap and gaudy. Quietly, they went out of fashion. That said, a recent wave of nostalgia for Victorian style and culture has seen something of a resurgence of interest in these so-called “period plants.” Geraniums are beginning to crowd chic balconies and domestic interiors across Europe once again. So be sure to keep an eye out for the genteel geranium!
