## Carolina Rice: An Imperial Gold Rush? 

### The Comeback Kid
  
Carolina Rice, the “heritage grain” lost to history in the post-antebellum era, has come back in a major way. Indeed, in a [2017 article](https://www.eater.com/ad/15973794/carolina-gold-rice-heritage-grains), _Eater_ declared that “The Grain Revolution is Here,” describing one company’s attempt to bring back the historical strain of Oryza sativa. Varieties of Carolina Rice, in particular, the “Carolina Gold” strain, have been attracting the attention of niche cooking websites and standard news sources alike, with outlets from [_Serious Eats_](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/05/carolina-gold-heirloom-rice-anson-mills.html) to the [_New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/dining/hill-rice-slave-history.html?auth=login-email&login=email) alike spotlighting the grain.

Yet behind Carolina Rice (which _Serious Eats_ refers to in part as “the Best Rice You’ve Never Tasted”) is a long and fraught history, which manifests stories of settler colonialism, slavery, and famine. The story of Carolina Rice spans the 18th and 19th centuries, and crisscrosses the globe, taking us from West Africa to the eponymous American colony to India. This history of Carolina Rice demonstrates the way that the British Empire, as well as newly independent America, was built through both the labor and knowledge of enslaved peoples. It was this very knowledge which transformed our present-day food systems across the globe, changing cultivation patterns and foodways across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

### What— and from Where— is Carolina Rice?

  

Carolina rice typically refers to the type of Oryza sativa, or Asian rice, that was grown in the Carolina Lowcountry during the colonial and antebellum period. Of this Oryza sativa, two different varietials existed: a Carolina White rice, and a Carolina Gold rice, distinguishable by the color of their husk. [An 1892 work on the different types of rice](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/82844#page/27/mode/1up) describes the White Seed Carolina as a “white, flinty grain...which has given Carolina Rice a world-wide reputation.” By contrast, in the author’s estimation, the Carolina Gold seed was “a large plump grain, heavy yielder, but apt to shatter and deteriorate.” This rice, [according to eighteenth-century naturalist Mark Catesby](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageimage/38993744), was grown in trenches in soil which is “usually two feet under water, at least two months of the year.”

	data-active="true"></var>

However, recently, scholars have noted that in addition to forms of Oryza sativa growing in Carolina, there were also types of Oryza glaberrima, or types of African rice growing in Carolina. Evidence of this red, nutty rice can be found in descriptions of plantations from this era. In the [1731 pamphlet The Importance of the British Plantations in America to this Kingdom...,](https://archive.org/details/importanceofbrit00hall/page/n6/mode/2up) — which is according to historian A.S. Salley the “first published account that the writer has been able to find of the beginning of rice culture in South Carolina”— the pamphleteer describes a “Red Rice in Contradistinction to the White, from the Redness of the inner Husk or Rind of this Sort, tho’ they both clean and become white alike.”[^ref1]

	data-type="geojson"
	data-url="https://jstor-labs.github.io/plant-humanities/geojson/west africa.json"
	data-active="true"></var>

How exactly did these two types of rice make it across the oceans to Carolina? During the middle passage, European slave-traders relied on African crops, as well as transplanted higher-yielding varieties of Asian rice, in order to keep both the newly enslaved peoples, and their captors, fed on the journey.[^ref2] Rice, then, most likely came from West Africa, an unintended consequence of the violent Middle Passage. Contemporary sources suggest as much. Guillaume Thomas Raynal, a French thinker of the Enlightenment, wrote in an English edition of a work [published in 1798](https://books.google.com/books?id=0YdaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA402&lpg=PA402&dq=Opinions+differ+about+the+manner+in+which+rice+hath+been+naturalized+in+Carolina.+But+whether+the+province+may+have+acquired+it+by+shipwreck,+or+whether+it+may+have+been+carried+there+with+slaves,+or+whether+it+be+sent+from+England,+it+is+certain+the+soil+is+favourable+for+it.&source=bl&ots=SguqqW9ojc&sig=ACfU3U2wQdmA9nVXPAvoG8_IMxBvjq0N2Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwisrpuxwPfoAhVsmXIEHa3NDhsQ6AEwAHoECAsQKQ#v=onepage&q&f=false), “Opinions differ about the manner in which rice hath been naturalized in Carolina. But whether the province may have acquired it by shipwreck, or whether it may have been carried there with slaves, or whether it be sent from England, it is certain the soil is favourable for it.” Scholars such as Peter Wood have declared that Raynal’s middle hypothesis was the correct one, as no European group present in the Carolina colony had experience cultivating the crop. [^ref3]

### Growing Rice in Carolina

  

But it was not enough to merely bring the seed to Carolina. Rather, tidal-basin cultivation, as the naturalist Catesby documents occurring in Carolina, was a specialized form of cultivation unknown at the time in England. This specialized knowledge and technology is highlighted in natural histories of the period. Consider [Catesby’s discussion of the wetland cultivation of rice](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/120381#page/41/mode/1up) in colonial America: “In March and April it is sown in shallow trenches made by the Hough, and good Crops have been made without any further Culture than dropping the seeds on the bare ground and covering it with the Earth, or in little Holes made to receive it without any further management.” Here, Catesby uses the passive voice, which is not uncommon in his agricultural prescriptions. And yet, what is notable is what is missing; the seemingly innocuous usage of the passive voice in fact erases the essential contributions and knowledge of enslaved people, without which Carolina rice would not have come to America and the crop in general could not have been cultivated in the wetlands.
 <var data-primary="image"></var>
<var data-image id="nypl-1235183" title="Late 19th-Century Drawing of the Rice Planting Process on a Carolina Plantation" data-fit="cover" data-url="https://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=1235183&t=w"></var>

Doubt that this sort of wetland rice cultivation was brought to Carolina by enslaved peoples has been put to rest by geographer Judith Carney. In her path-breaking work Black Rice, Carney details how the “preparation of tidal floodplains for rice cultivation followed principles remarkably similar to those of the mangrove rice system [in West Africa].”[^ref4] This was an incredibly intricate system, which required embankments, ditches, drainage valves, and more. As Carney explains it was only with the knowledge of mangroves in West Africa could such systems have been built in Carolina.

But it is not only this clue that indicates the basis of Carolina rice cultivation rested in the knowledge of enslaved peoples. Catesby makes the role of enslaved people in rice cultivation implicitly known [through his reference to the “Hough”](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/120381#page/41/mode/1up) that makes “shallow trenches” in the land. The hoe, as a tool, was not prominent in European agriculture at the time, “which relied principally on draft animal traction”; such metal tools were not used by the local Native American population either. By contrast, in colonial-era West Africa, the hoe was the primary tool used for field preparation.[^ref5] Catesby’s reference to the “Hough” thus belies a long history of West African knowledge being used in the Carolina’s.

Catesby, in the penultimate sentence of his description of rice, finally reveals the role of enslaved peoples in the crop’s production, [writing](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/120381#page/41/mode/1up), “they use a Hand-Mill, yet there remains an inner Film which clouds the Brightness of the grain, to get off which it is beat in large wooden Mortars, and Pestles of the same, by Negro Slaves, which is very laborious and tedious.” This mortar and pestle tool, another technology used in West Africa, was employed almost exclusively by women, demonstrating the gendered aspect of rice cultivation.

From this knowledge of enslaved people, particularly that of women, rice quickly became a popular cash crop grown in the American colonies. According to [an 1892 work on the history of rice by “Dan Talmage’s Sons,”](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/82844#page/18/mode/1up) in the 1720s, annual rice production averaged about 10 million pounds; in just two decades, that number more than doubled in just two decades to over 25 million pounds per year by the 1740s. Indeed, Carolina rice was the “region’s dominant export,” and a major player in the Western European market for rice.[^ref6]

### Carolina Rice Beyond Carolina

  The knowledge of enslaved peoples concerning the cultivation of rice did not only affect American agricultural systems. Rather, their knowledge spread throughout the British Empire, concomitant with the transfer of seeds. One clear example can be found in the introduction of Carolina rice to India in the 19th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, British food distribution policies, exacerbated by droughts which caused the failure of the rice crop, killed millions; scholar Mike Davis famously referred to these famines as “Late Victorian Holocausts.”[^ref7]
<var data-map title="carolina_rice_transfers" data-center="12.586420, -8.107447" data-zoom="2"></var>
<var data-map-layer

	data-active="true"></var>

By the 1860s, British imperialists believed something had to be done to justify their rule in India, which the horrors of famine were undermining. What was thought to be the panacea for these famines? Carolina rice (most likely of the Gold varietal), whose distinct cultivation conditions were understood, according to an [1880 memorandum by L. Liotard published in Calcutta](https://books.google.com/books?id=icUIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA77&dq=carolina+rice+bengal&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiN1ayK1eDoAhWGgnIEHfpLCokQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false), to be of “much superior to that of the ordinary paddy,” and thus better able to withstand environmental factors. In accordance with this belief, according to Liotard, in 1868, “ten tons of Carolina rice seed, for experimental cultivation in India, were obtained by the Secretary of State.” The seeds were then packed in 200 barrels; 120 barrels were sent to Madras, 45 barrels were sent to Burma, 15 Barrels were sent to Bombay, 5 barrels sent to the Central Provinces, and 15 barrels were reserved for the “Government of India.”

	data-active="true"></var>


With this rice came knowledge from the enslaved people, which was codified and exploited through travel across the continents in the memoranda and instructions of the British imperialists. According to a memorandum put forth by the American consul in Bombay ([quoted in Liotard](https://books.google.com/books?id=icUIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA77&dq=carolina+rice+bengal&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiN1ayK1eDoAhWGgnIEHfpLCokQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false)), “Rice is sown in long drills made by hoes (machinery does not work well) about one foot deep.” While hoe-farming had long been present in Southern Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, the parenthetical note that “machinery does not work well” suggests that Carolina rice necessitated different sorts of tools compared to the typical rice grown in South Asia. In other words, the knowledge of the enslaved people on the beneficial use of hoes in farming Carolina rice spread, through the exploitation of British imperialists, from West Africa to Carolina to India, demonstrating the reach as well as significance of such knowledge.
<var data-map title="bombay" data-center="19.083495, 72.866069" data-zoom="8"></var>

	data-url="https://jstor-labs.github.io/plant-humanities/geojson/bombay.json"
	data-active="true"></var>

Despite the use of that knowledge, the Carolina Rice experiments in India were ultimately deemed a failure by the British imperial government due to [“floods, excessive rains, or drought, birds, insects,” as well as the “carelessness and indifference with which the experiments were conducted.](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/66916#page/219/mode/1up)” Historian Utsa Ray has deemed this reasoning part of the “Colonial discourse of ‘rational’ agriculture...based on cultural stereotyping.”[^ref8] And yet, while the rice never took in India, the story of Carolina Rice in India reveals the stark contrast of empire, in which British imperialist horifically exploited a group of people deemed to be sub-human, while not only profiting from said labor, but using their specialized knowledge to profit and maintain colonies half a world away.

### Conclusion

Through the complex history of Carolina rice, we not only see how rice was explicitly understood by the British imperial government as a means to prevent future calamities of rule, but also how the eating of rice— from America to Britain— was predicated not only on the toil of enslaved peoples, but also on their cultivation knowledge, brought to America on the violent middle passage. This interconnected history of the movements of plants and people suggests the ways that enslaved people influenced the food systems not only of the American colonies, but of the empire-at-large.
