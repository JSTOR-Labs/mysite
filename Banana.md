### Banana, Plantain, or the Tree of Life?
Thanks to domesticated bananas’ long history of human intervention and migration, Linnaean taxonomy did little to clear up the confusion surrounding identifications and names of banana plants. While scientists eventually deduced that Linnaeus identified two domesticated banana cultivars, not species, the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas as well as the origin of banana domestication remained a mystery. Recent genome and genetic testing, however, has revealed that the origin of banana domestication was further east than originally thought.

In 2002, a comprehensive study of relationships among wild and cultivated bananas determined that the parthenocarpic A genomes of almost all the edible banana groups derive from either subspecies _banksii_ (from the New Guinea region) or _errans_ (Philippines) of _Musa acuminata_ (or from both of them) ([Carreel et al. 2002](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/233368#b11)). These findings reveal that the origin of banana domestication was in the Philippines and New Guinea regions. Archaeobotanical remains identified as the genus _Musa_ attests that bananas were indeed present in New Guinea at least 10,000 years ago and were being cultivated as early as 7,000 years ago.

From the Philippines and New Guinea, domesticated bananas traveled along trade routes and with settlers and merchants both east and west. Along the way, 

Around 5,000 years ago bananas (of the genus Musa) arrived in Africa from across the Indian Ocean.

Europeans first encountered bananas, or accounts of the plant, through Alexander the Great’s Asiatic campaign in 331-323 BCE. According to Theophrastus and Pliny, one of the plants Alexander saw, recorded, and brought back to Asia Minor was the banana (some sort of Musa species). Unfortunately, Europeans had neither the climate to grow bananas nor the proximity to their natural habitat to import the fresh fruit. So, while bananas became a staple food crop in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, they remained an exotic curiosity in Europe.

The rise of European Maritime powers in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, brought renewed interest in the banana. By the time the Portuguese began exploring the west coast of Africa in the late fifteenth century, propagation of banana cultivars had spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Eventually, Portuguese slavers began transporting bananas alongside enslaved Africans to the West Indies. Unlike later periods, however, bananas were not viewed as a cash crop. Instead, they served as cheap and portable sustenance for the slaves during their horrific transatlantic crossing.

It was also a Portuguese physician and naturalist, Garcia de Orta, who would first promote the name “banana.” In 1563, while living in Goa, India, Orta published an herbal detailing the _materia medica_ of India, in which he wrote of a fruit found in India, Malaysia, and Arab lands as well in “[in Guinea, where they call them bananas](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/viewer/15528/?offset=#page=360&viewer=picture&o=search&n=0&q=banana).” Unfortunately, the name banana was slow to catch on. Other European authors of the period referenced bananas by several names including
