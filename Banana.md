## Chaos out of Order – Bananas and the Limits of Linnaean Taxonomy

Everybody knows what a banana is. At least we think we do. Today, the banana is a ubiquitous and easily-to-recognize fruit that even shares the same name or sounds the same in almost every modern language. Yet, despite the fact that you can identify the word for banana across cultures, the actual identification and classification of our modern-day banana is, to quote a popular idiom, “bananas.” It is a genetically modified mystery that continues to defy our system of plant taxonomy.

### What’s in a Name?
In 1753 Carl Von Linnaean’s seminal work, _Systema Naturae,_ formalized a system of nomenclature that standardized plant names and botanical terminology among botanists. This system used Latin binomial names—the first name indicating the genus, and the second the species—to identify and classify all living organism in the natural world. Unlike earlier attempts to group or classify plants, Linnaeus’s system focused solely on the reproductive features of wild plants (not domesticated or manipulated by man) to characterize, organize, and group related plants. While Linnaeus’s system was an artificial structure of classification and hierarchical divisions placed on the plant world, it provided order and standardization from the chaos of plant names created by centuries of disparate European collecting and cataloguing of the plant world. Although not intact in its present form, the Linnaean system has remained largely unchallenged for nearly 250 years.

However, despite Linnaean taxonomy’s international acceptance and longevity, Linnaeus’s system does have its limitations, which we can see in the case of the banana. This is because editable bananas are the product of a complex history of human dependency and exploitation. Linnaeus did not consider domesticated plants species, since they were the product of human manipulation. The two “wild” species of banana identified by Linnaeus–_Musa paradisiaca_ and _Musa sapientum_—were in fact domesticated editable cultivars. Unfortunately, Linnaeus was unaware of the banana’s long and complex history.

### Bananas, the First GMO?
Bananas are herbaceous plants, not trees, and while they resemble palms, they are not related. When the plant matures, it begins to form a large stem with a flower spike (or inflorescence) at the end. This large flower will eventually become a softball-size magenta bud. As the stem grows the large cone-shaped bud at the top weighs it down. Petal-like bracts grow between the overlapping scales surrounding the bud. These fall away to reveal clusters of flowers. Oblong fruit emerge from the base of the flowers. While the stem droops under the weight of the flower, and elongating male bud, the tips of the fruit grow towards the sun, giving bananas their distinctive curved shape.

Prior to domestication, wild banana fruits were incredibly seedy and difficult to eat. Scientists now believe that many wild bananas had a genetic predisposition to parthenocarpy, that is the ability to produce fruit without fertilization. Beginning some 7,000 years ago, human selection for parthenocarpy, along with the suppression of seeds by selecting and hybridizing for sterility, resulted in bananas that were sterile and produced fruits that were seedless. Since sterile bananas were easier to eat, humans began propagating wild banana hybrids with these mutations. To propagate a sterile plant, humans “cloned” bananas by collecting and planting the “ramets” or “suckers” of the original plant.

Like humans, wild bananas are diploids: they have two sets of chromosomes and receive one set from each “parent.” Thanks to human selection, migration, and exchange, however, some banana hybrids produced triploids, meaning the offspring inherited three sets of chromosomes. This extra set of chromosomes rendered triploid bananas sterile and even more inclined to parthenocarpy. More importantly, thanks to their extra chromosomes, mutations can arise even in clonal propagation (via suckers). This genetic diversity created an important source of variability among banana cultivars. The genetic diversity of triploids and their environmental adaptability ensured not only the survival of seedless banana cultivars, but also their ability to spread across vast areas and cultures.

While more diverse that previously understood, Scientists have identified _Musa acuminata_ as the primary wild parent of parthenocarpic bananas within the genus _Musa_. Parthenocarpy, however, makes identifying and classifying banana “species” difficult. As J. Kennedy explains, “Although it is clear that parthenocarpy within section _Musa_ has occurred only in _Musa acuminata_, the parentage of the resulting edible bananas is greatly complicated by the diversity of _Musa acuminata_ at subspecies level. Parthenocarpy probably developed in at least two of these subspecies, and there are many edible hybrids between these and additional wild subspecies.” Further complicating matters are hybridizations between _Musa acuminata_ and _Musa balbisiana_. _Musa balbisiana_ remains less understood than _Musa acuminata_, and has not been divided into subspecies. The distribution, wild/cultivated status, and genetic characterization of _Musa acuminata_ and _Musa balbisiana_ hybrids continues to be debated.

### The Banana Goes Global
Thanks to domesticated banana hybrids’ long history of human intervention and migration, Linnaean taxonomy did little to clear up the confusion surrounding identifications and names of banana plants. While scientists eventually deduced that Linnaeus identified two domesticated banana cultivars, not species, the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas as well as the origin of banana domestication remained a mystery. Twenty-first century genome and genetic testing, however, has revealed that the origin of banana domestication was further east than originally thought.

In 2002, a comprehensive study of relationships among wild and cultivated bananas determined that the parthenocarpic A genomes of almost all the edible banana groups derive from either subspecies _banksii_ (from the Papua New Guinea region) or _errans_ (Philippines) of _Musa acuminata_ (or from both of them) ([Carreel et al. 2002](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/233368#b11)). These findings reveal that the origin of banana domestication was in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea regions. Archaeobotanical remains identified as the genus _Musa_ attests that bananas were indeed present in Papua New Guinea at least 10,000 years ago and were being cultivated as early as 7,000 years ago.

From the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, domesticated parthenocarpic bananas traveled along trade routes and with settlers and merchants both east and west. Along the way, these early domesticated bananas were hybridized with local subspecies in the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia, before eventually making their way to India. Finally, around 5,000 years ago domesticated bananas (of the genus Musa) arrived in Africa from across the Indian Ocean.

Europeans first encountered bananas, or accounts of the plant, through Alexander the Great’s Asiatic campaign in 331-323 BCE. According to Theophrastus and Pliny, one of the plants Alexander saw, recorded, and brought back to Asia Minor was the banana (some sort of Musa species). Unfortunately, Europeans had neither the climate to grow bananas nor the proximity to their natural habitat to import the fresh fruit. So, while bananas became a staple food crop in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, they remained an exotic curiosity in Europe.

The rise of European Maritime powers in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, brought renewed interest in the banana. By the time the Portuguese began exploring the west coast of Africa in the late fifteenth century, propagation of banana cultivars had spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Eventually, Portuguese slavers began transporting bananas alongside enslaved Africans to the West Indies. Unlike later periods, however, bananas were not viewed as a cash crop. Instead, they served as cheap and portable sustenance for the slaves during their horrific transatlantic crossing.

In 1516 Friar Tomas de Berlanga, a Catholic missionary, landed on the Island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and planted banana stems (or suckers) as means to continue to feed the growing African slave population. When Friar Tomas was made Bishop of Panama, he took banana plants with him to the mainland. Bananas were also carried to Mexico by the Spanish and eventually spread rapidly throughout Central America.

It was a Portuguese physician and naturalist, Garcia de Orta, who would first promote the name “banana.” In 1563, while living in Goa, India, Orta published an herbal detailing the _materia medica_ of India, in which he wrote of a fruit found in India, Malaysia, and Arab lands as well in “[in Guinea, where they call them bananas](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/viewer/15528/?offset=#page=360&viewer=picture&o=search&n=0&q=banana).” Unfortunately, the name banana was slow to catch on. Other European authors of the period referenced bananas by several names including
