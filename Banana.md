## Chaos out of Order – Bananas and the Limits of Linnaean Taxonomy

Everybody knows what a banana is. At least we think we do. Today, the banana is a ubiquitous and easy-to-recognize fruit that even shares the same name or sounds the same in many modern languages. Yet, despite the fact that you can identify the word for banana across cultures, the actual identification and classification of our modern-day banana is, to quote a popular idiom, “bananas.” It is a genetically modified mystery that continues to defy our system of plant taxonomy.

### Bananas, the First GMO?
Bananas are herbaceous plants, not trees, and while they resemble palms, they are not related. When the plant matures, it begins to form a large inflorescence, which produces both male and female flowers. As the inflorescence grows, a softball-size magenta bud (or _spathe_) forms at the end, weighing down the branched spadix. Petal-like bracts grow between the overlapping scales surrounding the bud. These fall away to reveal clusters of female (_pistillate_) flowers. Oblong fruit emerge from the base of the flowers. While the spadix continues to grow and droops under the weight of the _spathe_ (the male bud), the tips of the fruit grow towards the sun, giving bananas their distinctive curved shape.

Prior to domestication, wild banana fruits were incredibly seedy and difficult to eat. Scientists now believe that many wild bananas had a genetic predisposition to parthenocarpy, or the ability to produce fruit without fertilization. Beginning some 7,000 years ago, humans noticed that some banana plants produce seedless fruits. Since sterile bananas were easier to eat, humans began propagating wild banana plants with this mutation. To propagate a sterile plant, humans “cloned” bananas by collecting and planting the “ramets” or “suckers” of the original plant.

Selecting for edibility and propagating parthenocarpic bananas was the first step in the process of banana domestication. The next phase began as different human populations migrated, bringing their previously isolated banana species and subspecies along the way. Like humans, wild bananas are diploids: they have two sets of chromosomes and receive one set from each “parent.” Thanks to human selection, migration, and exchange, however, triploid banana hybrids were created. Hybridizing distant banana relatives produced plants that inherited three sets of chromosomes. This rendered the progeny plant sterile and ensured it would produce fleshy, seedless fruits. In addition to being sterile, triploid banana hybrids, thanks to their extra chromosomes, could still mutate. Further diversity of the species was produced as farmers selected and propagated for desirable mutations such as a starchy or sweet pulp. The genetic diversity of triploid bananas and their environmental adaptability ensured not only the survival of sterile banana hybrids, but also their ability to spread across vast areas and cultures.[^ref1]

While bananas are more diverse that previously understood, Scientists have identified _Musa acuminata_ as the primary wild parent of parthenocarpic bananas within the genus _Musa_. Parthenocarpy, however, makes identifying and classifying banana “species” difficult. As J. Kennedy explains, “Although it is clear that parthenocarpy within section _Musa_ has occurred only in _Musa acuminata_, the parentage of the resulting edible bananas is greatly complicated by the diversity of _Musa acuminata_ at subspecies level. Parthenocarpy probably developed in at least two of these subspecies, and there are many edible hybrids between these and additional wild subspecies.”[^ref2] Further complicating matters are hybridizations between _Musa acuminata_ and _Musa balbisiana_. _Musa balbisiana_ remains less understood than _Musa acuminata_, and has not been divided into subspecies. The distribution, wild/cultivated status, and genetic characterization of _Musa acuminata_ and _Musa balbisiana_ hybrids continues to be debated.

### What’s in a Name?
In 1753 Carl Von Linnaean’s formative work, _[Systema Naturae](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/728487),_ formalized a system of nomenclature that standardized plant names and botanical terminology among botanists. This system used Latin binomial names—the first name indicating the genus, and the second the species—to identify and classify all living organism in the natural world. Unlike earlier attempts to group or classify plants, Linnaeus’s system focused solely on the reproductive features of wild plants (not domesticated) to characterize, organize, and group related plants. While Linnaeus’s system was an artificial structure of classification and hierarchical divisions placed on the plant world, it provided order and standardization from the chaos of plant names created by centuries of disparate European collecting and cataloguing of the plant world. While the Linnaean system has been revised, modified, and added to over the centuries, it has remained largely unchallenged for nearly 250 years.
<var data-primary="image"></var>

Yet, despite Linnaean taxonomy’s international acceptance and longevity, Linnaeus’s system does have its limitations, which we can see in the case of the banana. This is because editable bananas are the product of a complex history of human dependency and exploitation. Linnaeus did not consider domesticated plants species, since they were the product of human manipulation. The two “wild” species of banana identified by Linnaeus–_Musa paradisiaca_ and _Musa sapientum_—were in fact domesticated editable cultivars. Linnaeus, however, was unaware of the banana’s long and complex history.

### The Banana Goes Global
Thanks to domesticated bananas’ long history of human intervention and migration, Linnaean taxonomy did little to clear up the confusion surrounding identifications and names of banana plants. While scientists eventually deduced that Linnaeus identified two domesticated banana cultivars, not species, the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas as well as the origin of banana domestication remained a mystery. Twenty-first century genome and genetic testing, however, has revealed that the origin of banana domestication was further east than originally thought.

In 2002, a comprehensive study of relationships among wild and cultivated bananas determined that the parthenocarpic A genomes of almost all the edible banana groups derive from either subspecies _banksii_ (from the Papua New Guinea region) or _errans_ (Philippines) of _Musa acuminata_ (or from both of them).[^ref3] These findings reveal that the origin of banana domestication was in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea regions. Archaeobotanical remains identified as the genus _Musa_ attests that bananas were indeed present in Papua New Guinea at least 10,000 years ago and were being cultivated as early as 7,000 years ago.[^ref4]

From the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, domesticated parthenocarpic bananas traveled along trade routes and with settlers and merchants both east and west. Along the way, these early domesticated bananas were hybridized with local subspecies in the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia, before eventually making their way to India. Finally, around 5,000 years ago domesticated bananas (of the genus Musa) arrived in Africa from across the Indian Ocean.

Europeans first learned of bananas through Alexander the Great’s Asiatic campaign in 331-323 BCE. According to Theophrastus and Pliny, one of the plants Alexander saw, recorded, and brought back to Asia Minor was the banana. Europeans, however, had neither the climate to grow bananas nor the proximity to their natural habitat to import the fresh fruit. So, while bananas became a staple food crop in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, they remained an exotic curiosity in Europe.

The rise of European Maritime powers in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, brought renewed interest in the banana. By the time the Portuguese began exploring the west coast of Africa in the late fifteenth century, propagation of banana cultivars had spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Eventually, Portuguese slavers began transporting bananas alongside enslaved Africans to the West Indies. Unlike later periods, however, bananas were not viewed as a cash crop. Instead, they served as cheap and portable sustenance for the slaves during their horrific transatlantic crossing.

In 1516 Friar Tomas de Berlanga, a Catholic missionary, landed on the Island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and planted banana stems (or suckers) as means to continue to feed the growing African slave population. When Friar Tomas was made Bishop of Panama, he took banana plants with him to the mainland. Bananas were also carried to Mexico by the Spanish and eventually spread rapidly throughout Central America.[^ref5]

### Banana, Fig, or the Tree of Life?
During this early period of renewed European interest in the banana, there was great uncertainty surrounding the identification, depiction, and name of the abundant yellow fruits Europeans encountered throughout Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and, thanks to their own transmission, the New World. While living in Goa, India, a Portuguese physician and naturalist, Garcia de Orta, adopted the name “banana” for the fruit. In 1563, de Orta published an herbal detailing the _materia medica_ of India, in which he wrote of a fruit found in India, Malaysia, and Arab lands as well in “[in Guinea, where they call them bananas](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/viewer/15528/?offset=#page=360&viewer=picture&o=search&n=0&q=banana).” In the early modern period, however, the name banana was far from universal.
<var data-primary="image"></var>
<var data-image id="Banana Orta" title="Coloquios dos simples e drogas da India" data-url="https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/i/?IIIF=/38/80/3b/be/38803bbe-3f4e-4f89-8df9-ac2ca5166d2e/iiif/ORT_Col_Simpl_Drog_1_000353.tif/183.5728155339806,107.65714285714286,1120.4271844660193,1573.6941176470586/!354,497/0/default.jpg" data-region=""></var>

The most influential European author of the period, Italian physician Pietro Andrea Mattioli, [referred to the banana plant as “musa” and the individual fruits as “muse”](https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10139456_00182.html) in his important herbal published in 1554. Musa, which was eventually adopted by Linnaeus as the name of the genus, is believed to be an adaptation the Arabic word for banana, “_mauz_” or “_mawzah_.” By the eighth century, Islamic expansion under the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) had reached the Indian subcontinent, creating a region of trade, exchange, and communication stretching from India to Iberia. Through these vast commercial networks, bananas were traded and became popular throughout the Islamic Empire.

	data-active="true"></var>

Italian physicians and naturalists like Mattioli, adopted the Arabic name for banana since it was through contact with the Islamic Empire in the late Middle Ages, as well as the writings of Islamic physicians such as Avicenna, that Italy was first introduced to the plant. Although Mattioli did not mention or describe the “musa tree” in the first edition of his famous herbal, its appearance in a later edition in Latin in 1554 is likely the first printed European herbal entry to describe banana.

The term “musa” was also used by the Flemish physician and botanist Rembert Dodoens in his herbal published in 1563. Unlike Mattioli and de Orta, however, [Dodoens provided an image of the musa or “Mose” tree](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6726349) (Mattioli would not add an illustration of banana to his herbal until 1565). Dodoens’s description of the banana tree as well as his image were taken directly from the work of Andrè Thevet, a French Franciscan priest who documented his travels through the Levant in 1549. [Thevet described bananas as resembling cucumbers](https://books.google.com/books?id=U91y-xxk0OYC&pg=PA213&dq=cosmographie+de+levant&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjog-H5-8roAhVnkHIEHbNGAvIQ6wEISjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false), yet the inaccuracy of his accompanying image casts doubts on if Thevet saw an actual banana plant. It is more likely that European travelers in the Levant came in contact with banana fruits in the markets and not on fruiting “trees.” In his herbal, Dodoens stated that bananas were trafficked through the merchants of India, Persia, and Venice, while Mattioli asserts the plant was already growing in Cyprus, Egypt, and even Sicily. Contact and trade with Islamic territories combined with southern Italy’s warm climate meant that Italy was likely one of the first regions in European to learn about and attempt to cultivate bananas in private as well as botanical gardens.

While the adoption of the Arabic word for banana provided some standardization of nomenclature, it was far from universally used. In fact, numerous names, sometimes contradictory, were given for banana. Confusing matters further was the enduring description as banana, not the fig or apple, as the forbidden fruit of the garden of Eden. In sixteenth century herbals, many authors, including Mattioli, Dodoens, [Clusius](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6781452), and [Cesalpino](bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idviewer/13478/129), described the banana plant as the tree growing in the Garden of Eden. The persistence of this tradition continued well into the eighteenth century. Even Linnaeus, [in his treatise on the banana palm](http://linnean-online.org/120150/), weighed in on the topic, ultimately dismissing the idea as a metaphor in his penultimate chapter. Finally, thanks to their geographic origin and early association with palm trees and dates, and enduring associations with the Garden of Eden, bananas were also often referred to as “Indian figs.”

By the seventeenth century, bananas had spread throughout the Caribbean and the tropics of Central and South America, becoming a dietary staple along the way. While bananas were known to Europeans through herbals, natural histories, and travel narratives, they remained a rarity on the continent—a lush, exotic fruit only travelers enjoyed.

Even Linnaeus had to rely on the garden and hothouse of the wealthy financier and director of the Dutch East India Company, George Clifford (1685-1760), to see and study a live banana plant. At his estate in Hartenkamp, Holland, and with the assistance of Linnaeus, Clifford successfully flowered a hybrid of _Musa acuminate_ and _Musa balbisiana_. The successful flowering and subsequent fruiting of the rare and exotic banana plant was so momentous that Linnaeus wrote a treatise on the plant, _[Musa Cliffortiana](http://linnean-online.org/120150/)_, published in 1736.
<var data-primary="map"></var>
<var data-map title="Hartenkamp, Holland" data-center="Q18771183" data-zoom="6.5"></var>

That same year marked the arrival of the German botanical artist Georg Ehret to Hartekamp. Ehret would provide the illustrations of Clifford’s flowering banana plant for the treatise as well as go on to diagram Linnaeus’s new plant classification system. It was also at the direction of Linnaeus, Ehret began adding details of the plant’s reproductive structures, or flowers, creating a new standard for botanical illustrations.

### Banana Republics
It was not until the nineteenth century with the developments of steamships and refrigeration, however, that the Central and South American banana would become a major global trade commodity. Thanks to these innovations, bananas began pouring into American cities after the Civil War. In Reconstruction America, bananas became increasingly popular as they were seen as a healthy and affordable commodity. Eventually, small-scale, independent cultivation was consolidated and replaced by large-scale production conglomerates, such as the United Fruit Company (UFC). Conglomerates like the UFC focused on cultivation practices and varietals that were easier to ship, more profitable, and desired by consumers. Overtime, one selected mutation of one banana cultivar in particular came to dominate the market, the Gros Michel, thanks to its hardy peel and sweet taste. Monocultures of Gros Michel swiftly supplanted most other banana cultivars in Latin America produced for the American and European markets.
<var data-primary="image"></var>
<var data-image id="LOC image" title="Banana Cart in New York City, 1902, courtesy of the Library of Congress" data-fit="cover" data-url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/master/docs/images/Banana_Cart_NYC_1902_LOC.jpg" data-region=""></var>

In the early 20th century, multinational American corporations, like the UFC, were also instrumental to the creation of the banana republic phenomenon. The UFC and other companies bought huge swaths of land and built massive infrastructure in Central and South American countries with environments that could support banana production, such as Honduras and Guatemala. Many of these countries had nascent democratic or unstable governments and quickly became economically dependent on exporting a single product—the banana. With such a grip on a country’s infrastructure and wealth, these companies also came to dominate the government, propping up corrupt dictatorships that exploited the working class and favored the economic interests of foreign corporations.[^ref6]

In the end, an intense monoculture focused on the vegetal propagation of one mutation of one banana hybrid proved unsustainable. Lacking genetic diversity, Gros Michel banana plantations across the globe fell victim to a pathogen known as _Fusarium oxysporum_, or “Panama Disease.” From 1899 to the 1950s Panama Disease destroyed Gros Michel crops throughout the Americas. Desperate to replace the valuable export, fruit conglomerates abandoned the Gros Michel for a new varietal, the smaller and less flavorful Cavendish banana.

### Bananas Today
Today the Cavendish banana remains the dominant cultivated and exported varietal of bananas. Just as it did in the twentieth century, the current global production of more than one million tons remains based on large-scale vegetative propagation of a small number of genotypes derived from a handful of ancient sexual recombination events. This makes the Cavendish varietal, like the Gros Michel, particularly susceptible to diseases as well as pests and climate change. Recent scientific studies on banana genetics and genomes, however, could hold the key to diversifying and revitalizing banana hybrids. For many scientists, the goal is to figure out banana’s origin story in order to produce new polyploid hybrids through genetic recombinations of fertile diploids, just as societies in Southeast Asia did thousands of years ago.[^ref7]

While we need to rethink how we select, hybridize, and propagate bananas, many scientists also argue it is time to recognize the limits of Linnaean taxonomy and rethink how bananas are classified. In 1955 an informal nomenclature system to classify banana cultivars was developed by Norman Simmonds and Kenneth Shepherd. Instead of assigning binomial names, Simmonds and Shepherd classified editable bananas into genome groups, according to the chromosomal contributions of their ancestral wild species (i.e. AAA, AAB, and ABB) and subgroups for closely related cultivars derived from mutation selection and propagation (i.e. the Gros Michel and Cavendish).[^ref8] While Simmonds and Shepherd had to rely on genome classification based on the visible morphology of banana cultivars, scientists today rely have more reliable genomic techniques, allowing them to analyze and reclassify the genetic make-up of hundreds of banana cultivars. This work has revealed that more than one hundred subspecies of _Musa acuminata_ have been implicated in the domestication of bananas. Despite this work, however, scientists still do not know just how many banana cultivars actually exist and are still working to formalize a genome-based classification system in the hopes of finally creating an internally coherent list of names for banana species, subspecies, and cultivars.[^ref9]
