### A Household Name
The Venus flytrap, *Dionaea muscipula*, is easily the most famous <param ve-entity eid="Q18240"> carnivorous plant. These are plants that attract, capture, and digest animal prey in order to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which they grow. Today, over 700 species possessing this specialized suite of adaptations have been identified, native to every continent except Antarctica. As the botanist <param ve-entity eid="Q157501"> Joeseph Dalton Hooker once proclaimed, “such vegetable sportsmen as the Sundew, the Venus’s Flytrap, and the Pitcher-Plants” have long been of interest to naturalists and the botanically inclined.[^ref1] Indeed, they have attracted the admiration of prominent scientists for hundreds of years, from <param ve-entity eid="Q1043"> Carl Linnaeus to <param ve-entity eid="Q1035"> Charles Darwin. Both men, having seen no small number of extraordinary plants in their lifetime, proclaimed the Venus flytrap to be among the “most wonderful” in the world.[^ref2] The story of this carnivorous curiosity highlights Transatlantic networks of correspondence and specimen exchange as critical to the rise of early modern botany, and traces the terrifying delights this tiny plant inspired through visual, poetic, and empirical mediums.

### Discovering Carnivory
In 1759, North Carolina governor <param ve-entity eid="Q709129"> Arthur Dobbs relayed news of a “Catch Fly sensitive” plant to his old acquaintance <param ve-entity eid="Q1350818"> Peter Collinson.[^ref3] Upon Collison’s request, the governor provided a more detailed description the following year. In June 1764, Collinson informed <param ve-entity eid="Q528476"> John Bartram of Philadelphia, a fellow <param ve-entity eid="Q170208"> Quaker naturalist, that he sent a dried leaf of the Venus flytrap, or “Tippitiwichet Sensitive,” to Linnaeus, whom he expected to “be in raptures at the sight of” it.[^ref4] Linnaeus’s response is not known, and it seems likely that the letter did not reach him.

<param ve-map-layer geojson label="The Venus flytrap's native range is limited to a roughly 50-mile radius around Wilmington, NC." title="Native Range" url="flytraprange-2.json">

Supposedly named for it's chaste white flowers, correspondence between Collison and Bartram casted light on the true etymological origins of the “Wagish Tipitiwitched sensitive.”  Alluding to the recent marriage of the seventy-three-year-old Dobbs to Justina Davis, fifty-eight years his junior, Collison wrote to Bartram that “It is now in vain to write to [Dobbs] for seeds or plants of Tipitiwitchet now [that] He has gott one of his own to play with.”[^ref5] This wry comment suggests that “Tipitiwitchet” was no more than a bawdy pun on the resemblance of the Venus flytrap to female genitalia. These earliest accounts of *Dionaea* demonstrate the plant’s “femme fatale” allure to English naturalists. This fascination was immortalized through the nomenclature proposed by <param ve-entity eid="Q934747"> John Ellis, a British linen merchant and naturalist. *Dionaea muscipula* can be literally translated as “Aphrodite’s Mousetrap,” conjuring up vivid images of the love goddess’s deadly <span data-click-image-zoomto="1192,1670,925,721">vulva-shaped trap</span> luring small animals to their death. Eighteenth-century sexual innuendo often relied on botanical metaphors, and plants sensitive to touch (i.e., Mimosa pudica) in particular were analogous to male and female sex organs. The extent to which such vernacular waggery might have influenced Ellis is unclear, but it certainly helped ensure the enduring place of the Venus flytrap as an object of curiosity within popular culture.

William Young, tasked by Queen Charlotte with gathering North American botanical specimens, brought living Venus flytraps to Europe in 1768. He sent some to James Gordon, a well-known nurseryman, and continued to advertise them around England and later France as late as 1783.  Although from correspondence William Bartram was likely the first to sketch *Dionaea*, Young produced a crudely colored illustration and labeled it *Youngsonia* in his never published *A Natural History of Plants* (1767). After the <param ve-entity eid="Q40949"> Revolutionary War broke out in North America, Young relocated his business interests to France, publishing his *Catalogue d’Arbres Arbustes et Plantes Herbacées d’Amerique* in 1783. Two years later, he fell down a river bank and drowned while plant collecting in Gunpowder Creek, Maryland.[^ref6]

Nearly a decade after its first description by Dobbs, Linnaeus received word of this mysterious New World plant. On 23 September 1768, John Ellis, his longtime correspondent, relayed a detailed account of the Venus flytrap. In his letter, Ellis described “minute sharp red spines, as if design’d by nature to stick into the insect, that is caught, to prevent it, escape by struggling.”[^ref7]  Linnaeus, who confessed that he had “never seen such a wonderful phenomenon,” presented this “most rare and singular plant Dionaea” to the Royal Society of Sciences at Uppsala, relaying to Ellis the Society’s thanks “for the most valuable communication ever received.”[^ref8] Indeed, he considered Ellis’s description so complete that “nothing can be added.” 
<param ve-video vid="O7eQKSf0LmY">

By 1770, Ellis published an edited version of this letter in his pamphlet *Directions for bringing over seeds and plants, from the East Indies ...*, which included the first published illustration of the Venus flytrap. In a 1768 letter to Dr. <param ve-entity eid="Q18783607"> David Skene, he mentioned that at a meeting of the Royal Society "Lord Moreton" (likely <param ve-entity eid="Q377335"> James Douglas, Earl of Morton) had posed a “Shrewd question … Do you think Sr that the plant receives any nourishment from the Insects it catches?”[^ref9]  Put on the spot, Ellis had to admit his ignorance in the matter. Yet this idea seemed to appeal to him, and later he described the plant as having a capacity to catch food in its leaves, pointing to the possibility of insects serving as nutriment. His published description, written as an open letter to Linnaeus reads, “The plant, of which I now enclose you an exact figure … shows that Nature may have some views towards its nourishment, in forming the upper joint of its leaf like a machine to catch food.”[^ref10] This description of the flytrap’s deadly mechanism marks a significant progress in his thinking about the plant as compared to his original unpublished letter to Linnaeus, in which he does not mention nourishment. The complex network of knowledge exchange surrounding this plant spanned much of Europe and frequently crossed the Atlantic.

       center="Dionaea muscipula">
			      
Linnaeus, however, did not appear to agree. His November 1768 letter to Nicolaas Laurens Burman sums up his opinion on the matter: “The leaves are more sensitive than those of <param ve-entity eid="Q148532"> Mimosa, and if an insect or fly crawls or sits on the leaf, it closes its eyes with hairy scales and spines so that the booty cannot slip out and when the prisoner is tired out, the leaf opens and lets it go.”[^ref11]  This notion was repeated almost verbatim in his *Mantissa Plantarum Altera* (1771).  Yet Linnaeus was nonetheless susceptible to the awe *Dionaea* inspired, dubbing it a *miraculum naturae* (miracle of nature) in *Systema Vegetabilium* (1774).  His incredulity about the strange trapping mechanism might simply be due to the lack of necessary empirical evidence. A dried herbarium specimen, similar to the one shown here, was likely the closest he got to this predatory plant.
<param ve-plant-specimen jpid="10.5555/al.ap.specimen.g00210232">

Following Linnaeus, *Dionaea* also garnered attention from the American naturalist and politician Thomas Jefferson. His first attempt to collect and share specimens of the Venus flytrap in the United States and abroad go as early as January 1786. During Jefferson’s stay in Paris that summer, he requested a shipment of “some seeds of the Dionaea muscipula,” perhaps to impress the Parisians with the wonders of the young nation.[^ref12] After nearly two decades of sporadic attempts to acquire the precious seeds, he was able to obtain some in 1804, towards the close of his first term as President of the United States. Preoccupied by his duties, he finally planted them in April 1809, after the end of his second term. The Venus flytrap had officially made its way into the most important garden in the continent.

### The Darwins’ ‘most wonderful’ plants

Charles Darwin’s enthusiasm for carnivorous plants is well documented. As early as 1859, soon after encountering the sundew *Drosera rotundifolia* on an English heath, the author of the *Origin of Species* wrote, "I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world."[^ref13] By September 1860 he was working with *Dionaea muscipula* as well, and would later dub the Venus flytrap “one of the most wonderful [plants] in the world."[^ref14]  Darwin’s rigorous experimentation with these enigmatic vegetal carnivores culminated in 1875 with the publication of *Insectivorous Plants*. This treatise laid the framework for the study of plant carnivory as it exists today and cemented the notion of carnivorous plants in the scientific and public imagination.
<param ve-entity eid="Q941356">

Yet Charles Darwin was not the first or the only one in his family to delight at the Venus flytrap and its murderous cohort. Indeed, his fascination with these plants developed over three generations of philosophical thought and scientific experimentation that included his grandfather and son. The family’s work with carnivorous plants reveals the enduring botanical legacy of Erasmus, Charles, and <param ve-entity eid="Q1333425"> Francis Darwin.
<param ve-image label="Dionaea muscipula trapping mechanism. Insectivorous Plants (1875)." description="Dionaea trapping mechanism" license="public domain" url="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageimage/46794379">

The latter half of <param ve-entity eid="Q234050"> Erasmus Darwin’s two-part poem *The Botanic Garden* (1789) sought to display the Linnaean sexual system through poetic analogies of plant sexuality and human affairs, accompanied by Erasmus’ own botanical notes and observations. He carefully weaved the mythological and the physiological discussion through poetic prose and technical footnotes, appealing to a broad audience of general readers and botanical experts alike. His stanza on *Drosera*, seen here, beautifully illustrates the tone of the work as a whole.

Erasmus considered the “viscous material” of the *Drosera* merely a mechanism to prevent “small insects from infesting the leaves,” “[a]s the ear-wax in animals seems to be in part designed to prevent fleas and other insects from getting into their ears.”[^ref15]  Darwin further relayed in his extensive notes to the reader that “[i]n the Dionaea Muscipula there is a still more wonderful contrivance to prevent the depredations of insects: [...] so irritable, that when an insect creeps upon them, they fold up, and crush or pierce it to death.” He had witnessed this “irritable” behavior of *Dionaea* firsthand in 1788 at Ashburn Hall, Derbyshire, subsequently receiving a colored illustration of the flytrap from <param ve-entity eid="Q18936200"> Maria Elizabetha Jacson. Jacson would later bring attention to plant carnivory in her *Sketches of the Physiology of Vegetable Life* (1811). Most illustrations of the Venus flytrap - including Erasmus Darwin's - were simply reproductions of Ellis' original plate, as seen here.

Erasmus Darwin’s conviction that these mechanisms — “curious contrivance[s]” to “prevent various insects from plundering the honey, or devouring the seed” — were a defense against insects is perplexing, placing so much emphasis on the damage a tiny fly could inflict on these plants.  Was he perhaps allowing poetic metaphors to guide his understanding of biological phenomena? While painting a vivid picture of “The fell SILENE and her sisters fair,” who “[s]kill’d in destruction, spread the viscous snare,” he was inclined to present his anthropomorphized botanical actors as righteous wardens rather than scheming hunters.

Yet carnivorous plants continued to assert themselves in poetry and philosophical thought at the turn of the century. Some authors expressed incredulity and wonder at carnivory as such, as did the Irish poet Thomas Moore in *Epistles, Odes, and Other Poems* (1806): “The Lord deliver us, Think of a vegetable being ‘carnivorous!’”  Moore’s verse parallels William Bartram’s lively 1792 description, “But admirable are the properties of the extraordinary Dionaea muscipula! [...] <span data-click-image-zoomto="1,1022,667,519">carnivorous vegetable!</span>”[^ref16]

It was not until 1860, when another Darwin, Charles, began pondering the lethal activities of sundews to make sense of the <span data-click-image-zoomto="238,3,1001,801"> Venus flytrap</span>. Over the course of the next decade, he sporadically worked with the <param ve-entity eid="Q156185"> Droseraceae. Among those who facilitated his study of these plants were the American naturalist <param ve-entity eid="Q6780853"> Mary Treat and Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, Darwin’s close friend and director of <param ve-entity eid="Q188617"> Kew Gardens, who supplied him with living specimens. Armed with this network of correspondents and the global resources of Kew, Darwin was able to carry out the investigations of carnivory from his backyard greenhouse at <param ve-entity eid="Q3038318"> Down House.
<param ve-image label="Curiosities of Natural History" description="Dodo, flytrap and elephant" license="public domain" region="-439,8,2348,1877" url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Above%2C_a_dodo%2C_a_venus_flytrap%2C_two_plants%2C_a_shell%2C_a_flyin_Wellcome_V0020667EL.jpg">

In the early 1870s Darwin’s passion for these plants reached a fever pitch. While focusing mainly on *Drosera*, he simultaneously studied carnivory in *Dionaea, Utricularia, Pinguicula,* and *Aldrovanda*. Meanwhile, Hooker occupied himself with the pitcher plants *Nepenthes, Sarracenia,* and *Cephalotus* at Kew. Inspired by a visit to Darwin’s home, Dr. <param ve-entity eid="Q28836"> John Burdon-Sanderson, one of the most prominent physiologists of the nineteenth century, was also compelled to investigate the mysterious behavior of *Dionaea*.

Burdon-Sanderson’s experiments showed that *Dionaea*’s leaves closed only when unsuspecting prey disturbed the electric current running through the plant, just as animal muscles contract in response to stimulus. Darwin further elucidated the nature of this ingenious trapping mechanism. He realized that the plant had “learned” to determine the prey that was worth capturing. Of the three trigger hairs on each lobe of the leaf, two had to be touched within 20 seconds of each other to trigger the trap. Continuous stimulation would cause the trap to seal shut and begin digesting its prey, while smaller insects could simply slip out and the trap would reset. Part of Darwin’s enduring impact on biology was his work that examined such evolutionary adaptation through various botanical lenses, with the Venus flytrap and other carnivorous plants serving as a prime example.

Darwin’s son, Francis, carried on his father’s legacy in a variety of ways, including his own research of plant carnivory. Francis’s passion for carnivorous plants first stemmed from aiding his father in his work on *Insectivorous Plants*, in which he is credited with illustrating the tiny underwater traps of *Aldrovanda* and *Utricularia. Drosera*, however, was the resounding favorite of both father and son. Nearly two-thirds of *Insectivorous Plants* was dedicated to the sundew. Being privy to his father's experiments, Francis sought to develop the book’s findings after the first edition was published.

Detractors of Charles Darwin’s carnivorous theory frequently pointed out that so-called carnivorous plants flourished in European hothouses year-round without any insect prey to feed on. Experiments that Darwin carried out while writing Insectivorous Plants sought to address this quandary but failed, as all the plants — fed or not — had died. Francis returned to the subject of his father’s beloved *Drosera rotundifolia* in 1877, finding out that the sundews that had been ‘fed’ doubled in seed production and size.[^ref17] Since these early experiments, many carnivorous genera have been proven to demonstrate increased size and biomass when the plants had access to insect prey. After his father’s death, Francis went on to publish a revised second edition of *Insectivorous Plants* in 1888, incorporating new discoveries to enhance the scientific understanding of plant carnivory.

### ‘Vegetable Wickedness’ on Display
The idea that a plant could eat meat has not been without controversy. French botanist Auguste Trécul denounced the carnivorous character of *Drosera* in 1855, and as late as 1867 his colleague Pierre Duchartre likewise declared the notion of carnivory unworthy of serious consideration. However, by 1875, the mountain of experimental evidence presented by Charles Darwin, alongside the work of Joseph Hooker, John Burdon-Sanderson, Mary Treat and others, finally convinced the scientific community that plants could indeed <span data-click-image-zoomto="1971,916,1419,1135">attract</span>, <span data-click-image-zoomto="2099,2439,1000,779">capture</span>, and digest <span data-click-image-zoomto="3378,1086,1140,911">animal prey</span>.

From that point on, carnivorous plants were less often portrayed as solitary botanical curiosities, but were instead grouped together in dynamic visual menageries. The relationship between the vegetal predator and its insect prey was increasingly the focal point of such illustrations. Rather than serving as simply a feature of its native environment, the Venus flytrap became associated with the nutrient-poor soils that prompted its alternative feeding habits. Botanical illustrators increasingly sought to display carnivory as a product of its harsh environment as ecology and evolutionary theory became ever more entwined.
<param ve-image label="Presenting carnivorous plants as a coherent group became commonplace after Darwin's Insectivorous Plants (1875). E.

Parallel to this shift in scientific illustration, an explosion of periodical literature featuring plant carnivory catapulted the Venus flytrap and its fellow vegetal carnivores into the public imagination. As Quaker author J.G. Hunt wrote of the sundew in “Natural History Studies” (1882), “Surely here, if anywhere, is vegetable wickedness.” Fictional accounts of man-eating plants regularly featured in Anglo-American periodical literature at the end of the nineteenth century, perpetuating far-fetched stories from fictional explorers encountering the “Man-Eating Tree” of Madagascar or the “Vampire Vine” of Namibia.[^ref18]

Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes, helped jumpstart this craze in 1880 with "The American's Tale." First published anonymously in the Christmas special of the London Society magazine, this short story centered around a man killed by a massive Venus flytrap in the Arizona wilderness. The legendary science fiction writer H.G. Wells also wrote of a botanist's blood-sucking orchid in 1905, laying the foundations for alien man-eating plants featured in musical, film, and television adaptations of *Little Shop of Horrors* and *Day of the Triffids* popular in the twentieth century.

As the Venus flytrap made this leap from Darwin's scientific publication to popular periodicals, it was also taken on as a protagonist of new media of educational and artistic display. The Blaschka Glass Flowers, commissioned in 1886 by Professor George Lincoln Goodale, the first director of Harvard’s Botanical Museum, included perhaps the first life-sized model of *Dionaea muscipula* for teaching, complete with a <span data-click-image-zoomto="1062,2031,1672,1337">tiny glass fly</span> frozen on the precipice of doom.

As countless stunning cultivars are grown commercially to feed the global plant trade, wild populations of *Dionaea muscipula* have become increasingly threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, pollution, and anthropogenic climate change. Nearly half of all carnivorous plants fall under <param ve-entity eid="Q48268"> International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) risk categories, ranging from near threatened to critically endangered. Despite wild populations being established in the United States and Carribean, *Dionaea* is currently listed as “vulnerable,” with hefty fines and jail time threatening potential poachers. Yet, today, the Venus flytrap remains on display in the living collections of almost every major botanic garden in the world. Frequently appearing in special exhibitions and displays, it continues to draw the fascination of millions of visitors each year. As countless individuals have struggled to find a place for this curious little plant within their social and scientific contexts, *Dionaea* has become firmly established as an organism of towering cultural significance.
