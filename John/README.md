### Test
It is notable that the first scientific description of *Dionaea* can actually be attributed to the Swedish botanist and Linnaean disciple Daniel Solander. One of Linnaeus’ most famous “apostles,” Solander set the precedent for having a naturalist aboard every British Royal Navy expedition. This paved the way for the travels of future proponents of evolution by natural selection, the ranks of which included Thomas Huxley, J.D. Hooker, A.R. Wallace, and Charles Darwin himself. Before embarking on his voyage of circumnavigation aboard the HMS Endeavor, Solander had left behind in England detailed notes with his taxonomic description of “Dionaea crinita.” However, having refused a professorial appointment carefully arranged by Linnaeus, pupil and master were not on amicable terms. After his voyage Solander triumphantly returned to England, never writing to Linnaeus again. Ellis rather opportunistically felt that delaying publication of such a miraculous discovery was impermissible, and according to the rules of modern botanical nomenclature he was the first to formally name Dionaea muscipula in print - not a month after Solander had left England. But the Western discovery of the Venus flytrap had actually been first recorded a decade prior.

In April 1759 the Governor of North Carolina, Arthur Dobbs (1689-1765), wrote to Peter Collinson (1694-1768) with the first extant description of Dionaea muscipula (a “Catch Fly sensitive”), sending a more detailed account in January 1760. Collinson subsequently communicated information about Dionaea to John and William Bartram, Daniel Solander, and Carl Linnaeus himself. Collinson also writes to Bartram in June 1764 that he sent a dried leaf of the Venus flytrap, or “Tippitiwichet Sensitive,” to Linnaeus, whom he expected to “be in raptures at the sight of.” Linnaeus’ immediate response is not extant and he appears to never have received the letter at all. William Young, the “Queen’s Botanist” in North America, first brought living Dionaea plants to Europe in 1768. He wentsome to James Gordon, a well-known nurseryman, and proceeded to advertise them around England and later France as late as 1783. William Bartram likely sketched Dionaea first, but interestingly Young produced a crudely colored illustration and named it Youngsonia in his never-published A Natural History of Plants (1767). It was under these circumstances that nearly a decade after its first description, Linnaeus would officially receive word of this mysterious New World plant.
