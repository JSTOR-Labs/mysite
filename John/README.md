### A Household Name
The Venus Flytrap, *Dionaea muscipula*, is easily the most famous carnivorous plant. These are plants that attract, capture, and digest animal prey in order to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which they grow. Today, over 700 species possessing this specialized suite of adaptations have been identified, native to every continent except Antarctica. As the botanist Joeseph Hooker once proclaimed, “such vegetable sportsmen as the Sundew, the Venus’s Flytrap, and the Pitcher-Plants” have long been of interest to naturalists and the botanically inclined.[1] Indeed, they have attracted the admiration of prominent scientists for hundreds of years, from Carl Linnaeus to Charles Darwin. Both men, having seen no small number of extraordinary plants in their lifetime, proclaimed the Venus Flytrap to be among the “most wonderful” in the world.

### Discovering Carnivory
In 1759, North Carolina governor Arthur Dobbs relayed news of a “Catch Fly sensitive” plant to his old acquaintance Peter Collison, a Quaker naturalist.  Upon Collison’s request, the governor provided a more detailed description the following year. In June 1764, Collinson informed John Bartram of Philadelphia, a fellow Quaker naturalist, that he sent a dried leaf of the Venus flytrap, or “Tippitiwichet Sensitive,” to Linnaeus, whom he expected to “be in raptures at the sight of” it. Linnaeus’s response is not known, and it seems likely that the letter did not reach him.

Correspondence between Collison and Bartram casts light on the etymological origins of “Wagish Tipitiwitched sensitive.”  Alluding to the recent marriage of the seventy-three-year-old Dobbs to Justina Davis, fifty-eight years his junior, Collison wrote to Bartram that “It is now in vain to write to [Dobbs] for seeds or plants of Tipitiwitchet now [that] He has gott one of his own to play with.” This wry comment suggests that “Tipitiwitchet” was no more than a bawdy pun on the resemblance of the Venus Flytrap to female genitalia. But the Western discovery of the Venus flytrap had actually been first recorded <span data-click-image-zoomto="1192,1670,925,721">a decade prior</span>.

These earliest accounts of Dionaea demonstrate the plant’s “femme fatale” allure to English naturalists. This fascination was immortalized through the nomenclature proposed by John Ellis, a British linen merchant and naturalist. Dionaea muscipula can be literally translated  as “Aphrodite’s Mousetrap,” conjuring up vivid images of the love goddess’s deadly vulva-shaped trap used to lure small animals. Eighteenth-century sexual innuendo often relied on botanical metaphors, and plants sensitive to touch in particular were analogous to male and female sex organs. The extent to which such vernacular waggery might have influenced Ellis is unclear, but it certainly ensured the enduring place of the Venus Flytrap as an object of curiosity within popular culture.

William Young, the “Queen’s Botanist” in North America, first brought living Dionaea plants to Europe in 1768.  He sent some to James Gordon, a well-known nurseryman, and continued to advertise them around England and later France as late as 1783.  Although William Bartram was likely the first to sketch Dionaea, Young produced a crudely colored illustration and named it Youngsonia in his never published A Natural History of Plants (1767).  After the Revolutionary War broke out in North America, Young relocated his business interests to France, publishing his Catalogue d’Arbres Arbustes et Plantes Herbacées d’Amerique in 1783. Two years later, he fell down a river bank and drowned while plant collecting in Gunpowder Creek, Maryland.

Nearly a decade after its first description, Linnaeus received word of this mysterious New World plant. On 23 September 1768, John Ellis, his longtime correspondent, relayed a detailed account of the Venus flytrap. In his letter, Ellis described “minute sharp red spines, as if design’d by nature to stick into the insect, that is caught, to prevent it, escape by struggling.”  Linnaeus, who confessed that he had “never seen such a wonderful phenomenon,” presented this “most rare and singular plant Dionaea” to the Royal Society of Sciences at Uppsala, relaying to Ellis the Society’s thanks “for the most valuable communication ever received.”  Indeed, he considered Ellis’s description so complete that “nothing can be added.”

By 1770, Ellis published an edited version of this letter in his pamphlet Directions for bringing over seeds and plants, from the East Indies ..., which included the first published illustration of the Venus flytrap. In a 1768 letter to Dr. David Skene, he mentioned that at a meeting of the Royal Society Lord Moreton had posed a “Shrewd question … Do you think Sr that the plant receives any nourishment from the Insects it catches?”  Put on the spot, Ellis had to admit his ignorance in the matter. Yet this idea seemed to appeal to him, as later he described the plant as having a capacity to catch food in its leaves, pointing to the possibility of insects serving as nutriment. As he later wrote to Linnaeus, “The plant, of which I now enclose you an exact figure … shows that Nature may have some views towards its nourishment, in forming the upper joint of its leaf like a machine to catch food.”  This description of the flytrap’s deadly mechanism marks a significant progress in his thinking about the plant as compared to his first letter, in which he notably does not mention nourishment.

Linnaeus, however, did not appear agree. His November 1768 letter to Nicolaas Laurens Burman sums up his opinion on the matter: “The leaves are more sensitive than those of Mimosa, and if an insect or fly crawls or sits on the leaf, it closes its eyes with hairy scales and spines so that the booty cannot slip out and when the prisoner is tired out, the leaf opens and lets it go.”  This notion was repeated almost verbatim in his Mantissa Plantarum Altera (1771).  Yet Linnaeus was nonetheless susceptible to the awe Dionaea inspired, dubbing it a “miraculum naturae” in his Systema Vegetabilium (1774).  His incredulity about the strange trapping mechanism might simply be due to the lack of the necessary empirical evidence.

Parallel with Linnaeus, Dionaea was also garnering attention from the American naturalist and politician Thomas Jefferson. His first attempt to collect and share specimens of the Venus flytrap in the United States and abroad go as early as January 1786. During Jefferson’s stay in Paris that summer, he requested a shipment of “some seeds of the Dionaea muscipula,” perhaps to impress the Parisians with the wonders of the young nation.  After nearly two decades of sporadic attempts to acquire the precious seeds, he was able to obtain some in 1804, towards the close of his first term as President of the United States. Preoccupied by his duties, he finally planted them in April 1809, after the end of his second term. The Venus flytrap had officially made its way into the most important garden in the continent.

### The Darwins’ ‘most wonderful’ plants

Charles Darwin’s enthusiasm for carnivorous plants is well documented. As early as 1859, soon after encountering the sundew Drosera rotundifolia on an English heath, the author of the Origin of Species wrote, ‘I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world.’  By September 1860 he was working with Dionaea muscipula as well, and would later dub the Venus flytrap “one of the most wonderful” plants in the world.  Darwin’s rigorous experimentation with these enigmatic vegetal carnivores culminated in 1875 with the publication of Insectivorous Plants. This treatise laid the framework for the study of plant carnivory as it exists today and cemented the notion of carnivorous plants in the scientific and public imagination.

Yet Charles Darwin was not the first or the only one in his family to delight at the Venus flytrap and its murderous cohort. Indeed, his fascination with these plants developed over three generations of philosophical thought and scientific experimentation that included his grandfather and son. The family’s work with carnivorous plants reveals the enduring botanical legacy of Erasmus, Charles, and Francis Darwin.

The second piece of Erasmus Darwin’s two-part poem The Botanic Garden (1789) sought to display the Linnaean sexual system through poetic analogies of plant sexuality and human affairs, accompanied by Erasmus’ own botanical notes and observations. He carefully weaved the mythological and the physiological discussion through poetic prose and technical footnotes, appealing to a broad audience of general readers and botanical experts alike. His stanza on Drosera beautifully illustrates the tone of the work as a whole:

Erasmus considered the “viscous material” of the Drosera merely a mechanism to prevent “small insects from infesting the leaves,” “[a]s the ear-wax in animals seems to be in part designed to prevent fleas and other insects from getting into their ears.”  Darwin further relayed in his extensive notes to the reader that “[i]n the Dionaea Muscipula there is a still more wonderful contrivance to prevent the depredations of insects: [...] so irritable, that when an insect creeps upon them, they fold up, and crush or pierce it to death.”  He had witnessed this “irritable” behavior of Dionaea firsthand in 1788 at Ashburn Hall, Derbyshire, subsequently receiving a colored illustration of the flytrap from Maria Elizabetha Jacson.

Erasmus Darwin’s conviction that these mechanisms—“curious contrivance[s]” to “prevent various insects from plundering the honey, or devouring the seed”—were a defense against insects is perplexing, placing so much emphasis on the damage a tiny fly could inflict on these plants.  Was he perhaps allowing poetic metaphors to guide his understanding of biological phenomena? While painting a vivid picture of “The fell SILENE and her sisters fair,” who “[s]kill’d in destruction, spread the viscous snare,” he seemed to present his anthropomorphized botanical actors as righteous wardens rather than scheming hunters.  In any case, being one of the most vocal English proponents of the Linnaean sexual system, Erasmus Darwin’s modest additions to Linnaeus’ sparse comments on Dionaea seem to have temporarily stymied further efforts to explain the plant’s violent behavior.

Yet carnivorous plants continued to assert themselves in poetry and philosophical thought at the turn of the century. Some authors expressed incredulity and wonder at carnivory as such, as did the Irish poet Thomas Moore in Epistles, Odes, and Other Poems (1806): “The Lord deliver us, Think of a vegetable being ‘carnivorous!’”  Moore’s verse parallels William Bartram’s lively 1792 description, included in his Travels Through North and South Carolina: “But admirable are the properties of the extraordinary Dionaea muscipula! [...] carnivorous vegetable!” 

It was not until 1860, when another Darwin, Charles, began pondering the lethal activities of sundews to make sense of the Venus flytrap. Over the course of the next decade, he sporadically worked with the Droseraceae. Among those who facilitated his study of these plants were the American naturalist Mary Treat and Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, Darwin’s close friend and director of Kew Gardens, who supplied him with living specimens. Armed with this network of correspondents and the global resources of Kew, Darwin was able to carry out the investigations of carnivory from his backyard greenhouse in Downe.

In the early 1870s Darwin’s passion for these plants reached a fever pitch. While focusing mainly on Drosera, he simultaneously studied carnivory in Dionaea, Utricularia, Pinguicula, and Aldrovanda. Meanwhile, Hooker occupied himself with the pitcher plants Nepenthes, Sarracenia, and Cephalotus at Kew. Inspired by a visit to Darwin’s home, Dr. John Burdon-Sanderson, one of the most prominent physiologists of the nineteenth century, was also compelled to investigate the mysterious behavior of Dionaea. 

Burdon-Sanderson’s experiments showed that Dionaea’s leaves closed only when unsuspecting prey disturbed the electric current running through the plant, just as animal muscles contract in response to stimulus. Darwin further elucidated the nature of this  ingenious trapping mechanism. He realized that the plant had “learned” to determine the prey that was worth capturing. Of the three trigger hairs on each lobe of the leaf, two had to be touched within 20 seconds of each other to trigger the trap. Continuous stimulation would cause the trap to seal shut and begin digesting its prey, while smaller insects could simply slip out and the trap would reset. Part of Darwin’s enduring impact on biology was his work that examined such evolutionary adaptation through various botanical lenses, with the Venus flytrap being no exception.
