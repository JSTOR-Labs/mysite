# Plant Humanities Search

## Overview

This is a research tool providing an easy way to retrieve information about entities (people, locations, events, etc) with links to relevant primary and secondary sources.

The [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) knowledge base is used for search interface and the core information for a selected entity. 

Entity data obtained from the Wikidata knowledge base is then used to find other related resources, including primary and secondary content from content providers such as [Artstor](https://www.artstor.org), [Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL)](https://www.bhl.org), [Global Plants](https://plants.jstor.org), [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org), [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), and many others.
