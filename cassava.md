## Introduction 
The native distribution of cassava spans from western South American to Brazil. Based on archaeological evidence, it is thought that cassava was domesticated in small garden plots around 8,000 B.C.E.[^1] From there, domesticated _Manihot esculenta_ spread through short-distance trade of seeds or stem cuttings from the plant, rather than by transporting the perishable roots. With a preference for warm and hot climes, today cassava can be found successfully growing in parts of North America, South America, Africa, the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and islands in the Pacific Ocean.

## A plant valued by ancient civilizations
In Peru, there is evidence from ancient textiles, pottery and archaeobotanical findings that the Moche (250-750 C.E.), Nazca (200 B.C.E.-600 C.E.)  and Chimú (1000-1470 C.E.) cultures all used and valued cassava.

To the right is an earthenware ceramic dating between the 5th and 7th centuries A.D. produced by the [Moche people](https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/node/2505) (1st-8th c. A.D.) in the northern Peruvian coast. The mouth is in the shape of [a stirrup-spout](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/moch/hd_moch.htm), to the front is a human-like head and neck, and the overall form of the legs and body is that of cassava roots. This [work of art](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/308558) carries significant insight into just how highly the Moche valued cassava. Bottles with the stirrup-spout opening are thought to have been used in a non-utilitarian way, such as effigy, ritual or decorative as it is hard to practically use vessels with this type of opening. The iconography evident in the anthropomorphic aspect of this vessel indicate that it is of a high ranking deity. The fangs curling out of the mouth indicate godly status, and the half-crescent headdress implies a high status. All of these details, accompanied by the fact that the body, tail and limbs of this figure are all modeled after cassava tubers, leads to the conclusion that cassava had a high status and was very important to daily life in Moche civilization.

## Indigenous Food Uses
Cassava is a starchy tuber and can be used to make a variety of dishes and beverages. Most commonly it is made into a starchy flour to produce breads and cakes, or it can be used to make fermented beverages. Some of the earliest descriptions of cassava as a food source are found in books written by European travelers to South America.

## Making Cassava Bread
The method of preparing flour from cassava is typically described as follows. First, the cassava root is grated, then it is soaked in liquid. Thereafter, the pulp is hung in a pleated basket or put under pressure to remove the liquid. The final step involves heating the pulp upon a hot surface. Images of indigenous peoples preparing the cassava root or making bread would recur in European texts from the 16th century through to the 18th century.

## Fermented beverages
Accounts of native peoples in South America and Latin America producing fermented beverages also permeate the records kept by European travellers, missionaries and conquerors. In the 16th century, a detailed account of the preparation of a fermented alcoholic drink was made by a Frenchman [Jean de Léry](https://books.google.nl/books?id=rK1hAAAAcAAJ&dq=Histoire%20d'un%20voyage%20fait%20en%20la%20terre%20de%20Br%C3%A9sil&hl=nl&pg=PA132#v=thumbnail&q=aypi&f=false) who visited Brazil. In the early 17th century a Spaniard, Antonio de León Pinelo, kept a very similar account of the process in Peru, and a British duo by the names of Bedford Pim and Berthold Seemann encountered the same process of cassava fermentation in the 19th century in Nicaragua.  Depending on the location, the beverage can be called _chicha_, _massato_ (a non-alcoholic variant mixed with honey), _acca_, _kufa_ or _mushla_.

The preparation process for chicha uses several tools.  The basic process is that cassava is either turned into flour or cut into pieces, then boiled, chewed and combined with saliva in the mouth for some time, then boiled again in a different vessel, then it is left to ferment for several days until it is ready for consumption. To the right are modern tools used to create chicha in Argentina. This shows that even today people continue to follow the traditional methods established by their ancestors to create fermented cassava beverages.

## Subsistence in Plantation Economies
Cassava played an important role as a food source for slave labour in plantations in 16th century Portuguese Brazil, and the Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. It was becoming established as a staple in the West Indies by the 17th century, as illustrated in Maria Sybilla Merian’s _Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium_ (1719). Merian’s book describes plants and insects she encountered during her stay in Dutch Surinam between 1699 and 1701. Her first entry on cassava notes insect activities revolving around the plant she encountered in June 1700. Her second entry describes cassava root as the ingredient for bread, a common food for both the indigenous peoples and Europeans living in America at this time.

The increasingly global spread of cassava took place alongside the forced movements of slave labour, leading to diasporic communities which brought along their uses of cassava. One such dish is _fufu_, an African dish made with a carbohydrate base, either cassava or plantains, and usually served with greens. This dish is known as _angú_ in Brazil, _mangú_ in the Dominican Republic, _mofongo_ in Puerto Rico, and _fufu de plátanos_ in Cuba. Today, _fufu_ is still a staple dish in parts of Africa.

## Innovation…
When they first encountered cassava, Europeans relied upon indigenous knowledge from Amerindians to learn how to prepare cassava for consumption. This knowledge travelled as the plant was first transplanted across the Atlantic to Africa. African women knew that the cassava root was poisonous, but they learnt to prepare its leaves instead. They discovered that young cassava leaves could be safely consumed after being boiled.

## …and Experimentation
Cassava exists in two varieties: sweet and bitter cassava. In their raw forms, both sweet and bitter cassava contain hydrocyanic compounds which are toxic to humans. The more bitter the cassava is, the higher the concentration of hydrocyanic compounds. Today, both varieties exist for the same species of cultivated cassava, _Manihot esculenta_. In the past, however, scientists thought they were two different species. A [1906 article on cyanogenesis](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/43363072) outlines various experiments which had been conducted on the cassava root to determine its composition. The article’s authors were still in favour of Pohl’s identification of bitter cassava as _Manihot utilissima_, and sweet cassava as _Manihot aipi_.

The botanical specimen on the right was collected by Pohl himself in Brazil. One inscription shows its earlier identification as Manihot utilissima, while a later hand updates the scientific classification to the name it is known today, _Manihot esculenta_ [Crantz](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/72216). Experiments to understand the natural world through chemical means can be traced back as early as [the 18th century](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/57980618), when Europeans began to write about methods of extracting the starch from cassava. The potential of cassava for industrial production would become more apparent in the 19th and 20th centuries.

## Diasporic and contemporary food uses

In 1887, American botanist, geologist, and ethnologist William Tufts Brigham published _Guatemala, The Land of the Quetzal_, in which he reported observations from his time in the book’s eponymous region. While visiting the town of Livingston, he describes being invited into people’s homes and witnessing the process of making cassava bread. He first notes the size of the cassava roots (twenty or thirty pounds) and their poisonous juice, before explaining how the bread is made.
Instructions for Livingston Cassava Bread:
1.Using a mahogany board with inserted quartz crystal, grate the cassava root into a coarse meal.
2.Wash the meal carefully and partly remove the starch, which will settle in the water as tapioca.
3.Place the meal in a serpiente, or a basket-work sack, which will serve as a press and squeeze the meal.
4.Make the pressed meal into flat loaves roughly three feet in diameter and less than an inch thick.
5.Dry and bake the loaves. 

The result, Brigham reports, is a “wholesome and very nutritious bread, which keeps a long time and is capital on an excursion.” Brigham notes that cassava bread also makes for:
•   “Excellent puddings”
•   A better accompaniment for soup than crackers
•   An indispensable snack in the woods
•   “A capital diet in dyspepsia”
•   A palatable food for sea-sickness that “serves to fill out the bony outlines of an emaciated human frame better than anything else.”

<param title="Java" eid="Q3757">
Brigham also remarks that cassava bread loaves are attractive and would be easy to export, and suggests they be sold overseas for their dietary benefits.
Brigham was not alone in his support of a more expansive cassava industry. Just a few decades before Brigham published Guatemala, the Director of Cultivation of Java ordered a new shipment of cassava to the island. A notable family from the island of Malacca also began  large-scale cultivation of the plant. Indeed, it seems that although there were earlier reports of cassava in Africa in the sixteenth century, it would take a few more centuries for the plant to become popularized beyond South America. English botanist Isaac Henry Burkill similarly observed that “there were two chapters in the establishment of the plant outside its home—one concerned with the carrying of it abroad as a vegetable, and the other with the establishment abroad of its industrial use. A long space of time separated them, as the plant was taken overseas as a vegetable about the year 1500, but the establishment of a tapioca [a cassava byproduct] industry outside America did not follow until two and a half centuries later.” Although it is difficult to ascertain by what routes cassava was taken overseas and exactly when it became popularized outside of South America, by the twentieth century, cassava was being actively grown as a crop in southern North America, central Africa, and South and Southeast Asia.

Here we see a photo of workers in the cassava industry in the Dutch East Indies taken around 1915. Burkill describes the process of making one particular Javanese cassava dish:
1.Peel cassava tubers
2.Steam the inner parts of the tubers
3.Cut steamed inner parts into pieces
4.Sun-dry or pickle the pieces in brine
5.Fry the cassava pieces

Today, cassava is still grown in Java, and in other regions around the globe. This resilient, adaptable root with nutritious value has long become an ubiquitous presence in our lives, from [tapioca school pudding](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/apr/13/tapioca-school-pudding-culinary-comeback) to [bubble tea](https://www.eater.com/2019/11/5/20942192/bubble-tea-boba-asian-american-diaspora). People all over the world continue to reinvent its meaning and connect to cassava in their own ways. Nigerian-American artist Njideka Akyunyili Crosby has featured cassava prominently in her work as she explores the ability of people, plants, and paintings to inhabit multiple spaces. For Crosby, cassava has a specific association with village life in Nigeria. In her painting _Cassava Garden_, she juxtaposes it with an Indian rubber tree from her life in Los Angeles to create an imagined garden where two plants that are not usually found together can coexist. Ultimately, she uses cassava and the Indian rubber tree to ask, “when does something belong to a place?”
