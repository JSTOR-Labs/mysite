# The Plant Humanities Initiative

## About the Plant Humanities Lab

The Plant Humanities Workbench uses original scholarship, linked open data and integrated primary and secondary resources to narrate and foster the exploration of the cultural histories and influence of plants.

The Plant Humanities Workbench will consist of a suite of interoperable, linked-open-data-powered tools.  The first of those tools is a Visual Essay tool which allows authors to create narrative essays featuring interactive maps, high-resolution images, primary sources and plant specimens.
